I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell Love yourself, girl, or nobody will Though you a woman I don't know how you deal With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you You wake up, put makeup on Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""

A place that small, it's hard to do Too much of her to run into And so much road to somewhere new  It ain't nothin' but a rearview town Broken hearts and rusted plows Roots ripped right up out of the ground Never thought I'd ever leave it It ain't nothin' what it used to be Population minus me On the other side of that dust cloud Ain't nothin' but a rearview town  It ain't nothin' but yesterday One less truck rollin' down Main Ain't nothin' left to say  It ain't nothin' what it used to be Population minus me On the other side of that dust cloud Ain't nothin' but a rearview town  Ain't nothin' but a rearview town"

I know you never lie, but I self-sabotage I know your love isn't just a mirage But I tend to panic if I can't reach out and grab it I need to get out all these bad habits  There's no need to explain I know what you wanna say 'Cause you say goodnight If you think that's alright There's no need to explain I know that we can relate Can we get up and try to feel okay again? Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Hey)  We can get up and try to feel okay again We can get up and try to feel okay again Okay"

I will not forgive you If you will not take the chance"" The sailor gave at least a try The soldier being much too wise Strategy was his strength And not disaster The sailor coming out again The lady fairly leapt at him That's how it stands today You decide if he was wise The storyteller makes no choice Soon you will not hear his voice His job is to shed light And not to master Since the end is never told We pay the teller off in gold In hopes he will come back But he cannot be bought or sold   Inspiration move me brightly Light the song with sense and color Hold away despair More than this I will not ask Faced with mysteries dark and vast Statements just seem vain at last Some rise, some fall, some climb To get to Terrapin Counting stars by candlelight All are dim but one is bright: The spiral light of Venus Rising first and shining best Oh, from the northwest corner Of a brand-new crescent moon Crickets and cicadas sing A rare and different tune Terrapin Station In the shadow of the moon Terrapin Station And I know we'll be there soon Terrapin, I can't figure out Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning Terrapin, but the train's put its brakes on And the whistle is screaming Terrapin   While you were gone These faces filled with darkness The obvious was hidden With nothing to believe in The compass always points to Terrapin Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again For good or ill again"

Then please don't be surprised When you find me dreaming, too   Look into any eyes you find by you You can see clear through to another day Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes On other days while going home  What do you want me to do To do for you, to see you through? It's all a dream we dreamed One afternoon, long ago  Walk into splintered sunlight Inch your way through dead dreams to another land Maybe you're tired and broken Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear  What do you want me to do To do for you, to see you through? A box of rain will ease the pain And love will see you through  Just a box of rain, wind, and water Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on Sun and shower, wind and rain In and out the window like a moth before a flame  And it's just a box of rain I don't know who put it there Believe it if you need it Or leave it if you dare And it's just a box of rain Or a ribbon for your hair Such a long long time to be gone And a short time to be there"

Talking Heads,Life During Wartime,"56 ContributorsLife During Wartime Lyrics Heard of a van that's loaded with weapons Packed up and ready to go Heard of some gravesites out by the highway A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I've lived all over this town  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now  Transmit the message to the receiver Hope for an answer some day I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime I might not ever get home  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around This ain't no Mudd Club or C.B.G.B.  I ain't got time for that now  Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.? You oughta know not to stand by the window Somebody see you up there I got some groceries, some peanut butter To last a couple of days But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones Ain't got no records to play  Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard I ain't got time for that now  Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock We blended in with the crowd We got computers, we're tapping phone lines I know that that ain't allowed We dress like students, we dress like housewives Or in a suit and a tie I changed my hairstyle so many times now I don't know what I look like  You make me shiver, I feel so tender We make a pretty good team Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving You ought to get you some sleep Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won't help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace The burning keeps me alive Get your instructions, follow directions"

What if you lied? What if I avenge? What if eye for an eye?  I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question I'll just ask one question What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

That I'd walk so far just to take The injury of finally knowin' you?  It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la) It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la) You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la) Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown And there are some people, love, who are better unknown"

When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes Well, you took me to hell too And all at once, the ink bleeds A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme But I've felt a hole like this Never before and ever since  If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary What we thought was for all time was momentary Still alive, killing time at the cemetery Never quite buried You cinephile in black and white All those plot twists and dynamite Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry You said I'm the love of your life  You shit-talked me under the table Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles I wish I could un-recall How we almost had it all Dancing phantoms on the terrace Are they second-hand embarrassed That I can't get out of bed 'Cause something counterfeit's dead? It was legendary It was momentary It was unnecessary Should've let it stay buried  Oh, what a valiant roar What a bland goodbye The coward claimed he was a lion I'm combing through the braids of lies ""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind"" Our field of dreams engulfed in fire Your arson's match, your somber eyes And I'll still see it until I die You're the loss of my life"

Then it's over, no matter what your faith is I'm a creature  There's a creature in my closet I can hear him rumblin' 'round The demons screamin' in the distance Creates such a humblin' sound The monster that's outside my window He's like family to me now The things that people are afraid of Never let me down  Yeah, I managed to get myself in trouble, all of this pain Yeah, I'm down and the double-dosin', liquor's always to blame If I could keep myself sober, I'd keep my hands to myself I take a shot and it's over, that's how I end up in Hell (I do) I hope I don't pass it down to my offspring (Yeah) They get everything from their daddy, feel like I'm addicted to all things (Yeah) Yeah, there's no reason to change, gone too far now And I'm stuck in my ways, back at the bar now They said I'm a flirt and they right (Yeah), I ain't perfect, aight? (Yeah) So when I'm thirsty and perkin' and purposely searchin' for somethin' it's hurtin' me so I just get back up and go, I just back out of a show That's how it go, I knock the back out a ho And next night act I don't know (Okay) I think they be laughin' at me, hands be grabbin' at me Feel like God let it happen to me That'd be blasphemy And at least it be happenin' naturally (Okay, yeah) I think I better let it go (Yeah) Either that or I gotta let her know And I can't do that  There's a creature in my closet I can hear him rumblin' 'round The demons screamin' in the distance Creates such a humblin' sound The monster that's outside my window He's like family to me now The things that people are afraid of Never let me down"

Release this passion within My fat ass gettin' bigger, I need to get back to the gym I'm lookin' at myself like how the fuck this happened again? Baby-Mama got out of jail and she done relapsed again I swear I'm tellin y'all the truth, there's so much shit in the air My father got leukemia, he just left critical care Not to mention mama's got dementia, man, she's always feelin' sick I try to help her pay the rent but she's unhappy as it gets I cannot complain because my daughter's doin' great Plus this music shit's a dream, what the fuck you think it ain't? But please make no mistake, baby after the show I'm all alone on this road headin' back to my home  I try not to think of hard times I try hard to let the past go I thank God that I'm a changed man But somedays I'm that same asshole The same old me, the same backroads A couple of crosses and a black rose Singin' the same old sad songs"

What's wrong with me? Am I that bad? You felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it Just to turn around, turn around And break it right back, break it right back  You knew my past and begged me to try To love again, because it'd end different this time But words are just words, and you're just a guy And I'm just the girl you looked at like a prize  You weren't supposed to be just like the rest You swore up and down that, you loved me to death Now we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex 'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less Oh, why does this happen every time? What's wrong with me? Am I that bad? You felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it Just to turn around, turn around And break it right back  So go use your fancy big words at your fancy big job Tell your friends how you're right and how I'm just so wrong And how you do it all, and I don't do enough How you can't settle down with a girl that lives on a tour bus  You weren't supposed to be just like the rest You swore up and down that, you loved me to death Now we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex 'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less Oh, why does this happen every time? What's wrong with me? Am I that bad? You felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it Just to turn around, turn around And break it right back"

What is yours and what is mine? 'Cause there is no more new frontier But we have got to make it here We satisfy our endless needs And justify our bloody deeds In the name of destiny And in the name of God  And you can see them there On Sunday morning And stand up and sing about What it's like up there They call it paradise I don't know why You call someplace paradise Kiss it goodbye"

I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy ""Too young for him,"" they told her Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waitin' for the soldier to come back again Nevermore to be alone When the letter says, ""A soldier's comin' home""  So the letters came from an army camp In California then Vietnam And he told her of his heart, it might be love And all of the things he was so scared of He said, ""When it's gettin' kinda rough over here I sit and think about that day on the pier And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""  I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy ""Too young for him,"" they told her Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waitin' for the soldier to come back again Nevermore to be alone When the letter says, ""A soldier's comin' home""  One Friday night at a football game The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang And a man said, ""Folks, would you bow your heads For a list of local Vietnam dead?"" Well, cryin' all alone underneath the stands Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band And one name read, and nobody really cared Except that pretty little girl with a bow in her hair  And I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy ""Too young for him,"" they told her Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waitin' for the soldier to come back again Nevermore to be alone When the letter says, ""A soldier's comin' home"" When the letter says, ""A soldier's comin' home"""
Cody Johnson,Cowboy Like Me,"5 ContributorsCowboy Like Me Lyrics I got to thinking about all the stuff we worry about and I realized that All that a man really needs Is a horse you can catch when you need him A dog that'll come when you call A good friend who owns an arena And a trailer that's legal to haul A woman who'll share my frustrations When the cow market's falling apart A pair of good spurs, a saddle that fits And a one-ton Ford pick-up that starts Everything else is window-dressing  I'm out here chasin' these rainbows that I need to find I go and Lord knows it kills me to leave her behind She drew a low card when she gave me her heart And sometimes it's hard to believe That sweet little angel went and got herself tangled In the arms of a cowboy like me  Well, I know she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights Smoky bars and guitars don't make for no fairytale life And every time I head home, I think I'll find her gone But she's still there and still wants to be In the arms of a cowboy like me  She's worn a hole in the carpet between the bed and the phone She worries about me when I leave 'til I'm back home 'Cause there's downtime for killin' There's whiskey and there's women That's just right for fillin' a need Oh, but she's in no danger There's no room for a stranger In the arms of a cowboy like me  I know she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights Smoky bars and guitars don't make for no fairytale life Every time I head home, I think I'll find her gone But she's still there and still wants to be In the arms of a cowboy like me  Yeah, every time I head home, I think I'll find her gone But she's still there and still wants to be In the arms of a cowboy like me In the arms of a cowboy like me A cowboy like me"

Creedence Clearwater Revival,Lodi,"21 ContributorsLodi Lyrics Just about a year ago I set out on the road Seekin' my fame and fortune And lookin' for a pot of gold Things got bad and things got worse I guess you know the tune Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  Rode in on the Greyhound I'll be walkin' out if I go I was just passin' through Must be seven months or more Ran out of time and money Looks like they took my friend Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  The man from the magazine Said I was on my way Somewhere I lost connections I ran out of songs to play I came into town a one night stand Looks like my plans fell through Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  If I only had a dollar For every song I sung Every time I've had to play While people sat there drunk You know I'd catch the next train Back to where I live Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again"
