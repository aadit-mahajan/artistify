Elton John actually described this song as Read More  I remember when rock was young Me and Susie had so much fun Holding hands and skimming stones Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own But the biggest kick I ever got Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock  Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking When your feet just can't keep still I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights When Susie wore her dresses tight And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight  Laa, la-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa  But the years went by and the rock just died Susie went and left us for some foreign guy Long nights crying by the record machine Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans But they'll never kill the thrills we've got Burning up to the Crocodile Rock Learning fast as the weeks went past We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last  Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking When your feet just can't keep still I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights When Susie wore her dresses tight And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight  Laa, la-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa  I remember when rock was young Me and Susie had so much fun Holding hands and skimming stones Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own But the biggest kick I ever got Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock  Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking When your feet just can't keep still I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights When Susie wore her dresses tight And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight  Laa, la-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa  Laa, la-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa  Laa, la-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa La-la-la-la-laa","[[0.0, 0.0025874241167830156, 0.008622108241424033, 0.00036740686224801824, 0.0004609776226576442, 0.0, 0.004237050667974999, 0.006573746941351561, 0.0005007713742375858, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.007337406230141768, 0.00797398630821976, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0024554208806905776, 0.004359040984480961, 0.0033183721067771015, 0.0, 0.026716363539357624, 0.00338216989778343, 0.009744322726872043, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0013427996592855736, 0.002071114838064696, 0.0, 0.0, 0.020682392848345017, 0.0017150297730150407, 0.00527134531479714, 0.0, 0.0004634419263450296, 0.0060193532681225076, 0.004545914168860455, 0.006096061508203954, 0.0, 0.0006740942315481544, 0.0008681461756877656, 0.005416612275569922, 0.0017017132345125295, 0.0, 0.00529513319468396, 0.013153564099911032, 0.0, 0.003535343119295873, 0.0020564425392046405, 0.002584539533168754, 0.003755624499952583, 0.002549237781237106, 0.0, 0.0009262100005446051, 0.002105614430151563, 0.008792274864693637, 0.002043695877994998, 0.0, 0.006645711838642071, 0.0012324696171235182, 0.0017094367139563252, 0.007577221226886047, 0.0007889950447797518, 0.0070748024111778884, 0.007204702572331356, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0029579103026630116, 0.0005379973384034832, 0.0, 0.011861244560478934, 0.0003618690670784056, 0.0, 0.0, 0.011693594963625084]]"

Wallows,Pleaser,"52 ContributorsPleaser Lyrics You're talking while you're fast asleep As I walk slowly from your house Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you But couldn't leave my mouth Does it come as a surprise? Language of averted eyes Silence is what I do best  Still, I hear it all Wasting time around my head So I talk to myself instead  Sitting out the weekend Couldn't do it again Say you want it right now But I wouldn't know how It's something that I can't do Then what am I supposed to? Quite the people pleaser If only I could please her  Indecisive feelings of enjoyment Hold the thought, I think I need a moment I'm aware there's somethin' I should tell you But my voice annoys me Bite my tongue off with a smile I can't feel it anymore 'Cause recently the line is blurred Between depression and bliss  Now I see that the times don't change They waste away But I just wanna sleep today And I don't wanna talk to you right now You say  But, I'm sitting out the weekend Couldn't do it again Say you want it right now But I wouldn't know how It's something that I can't do Then what am I supposed to? Quite the people pleaser If only I could please her  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh  I'm talking while you're next to me Did I ruin the moment? If I could tell you how I feel Would you know what the words meant? For sake of conversation Could you read the writings on my sleeve?

It's been a hell of a week, but you're all grown now There's smoke seepin' out of your bloody teeth But you're home somehow  And I'll be upstairs with the guitar I's given When I was barely fourteen When did McGlinchy's get so crowded And why are th crowds so damn green? I lost my mind on the streets of the city And maybe I lost all hope too Took twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me To get to this evening with you  How lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week, but we're all grown now There's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street But we're home somehow  How lucky are we?

Zach Bryan,Something in the Orange,"23 ContributorsSomething in the Orange Lyrics It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy But when you place your head between my collar and jaw I don't know much, but there's no weight at all  And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't 'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done  To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am Where the hell am I supposed to go?

I doubt it, forget about it, whatever It's all the same anyways  I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown In the name of someone I no longer know For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone Traffic lights and a transmitter radio I don't like that when they threw me in the car I gave your name as my emergency phone call Honey, it rang and rang Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you  I'm untetherin' from the parts of me you'd recognize From charmin' to alarmin' in seconds I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize But that's morning, I'll forget it And the dial tone is all I have  I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown In the name of someone I no longer know For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone Traffic lights and a transmitter radio I don't like that when they threw me in the car I gave your name as my emergency phone call Honey, it rang and rang Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you  Well, I'd die for you  I beg you, sir, just let me call I'll give you my blood alcohol I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back """"Son","[[0.006168360880874648, 0.021520369725555055, 0.0, 0.005848215172488097, 0.0025621205588102812, 0.0, 0.0, 0.009251007704808025, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008258716685276588, 0.0, 0.002882021068484552, 0.0019513378817874497, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0019627360052676427, 0.0, 0.004317085500145828, 0.006727203290456836, 0.0, 0.007567127547593352, 0.000879776532418754, 0.0023084357814726303, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0038437771992982333, 0.019708755772081307, 0.0, 0.003142620126284643, 0.0006135213013232918, 0.012349966014628982, 0.0, 0.0016202138530854563, 0.00273400311657554, 0.0, 0.005121217904720104, 0.010567067428119714, 0.003998501725871442, 0.0, 0.0012061652009188431, 0.0, 0.0, 0.007296235282118355, 0.007995565914098252, 0.0, 0.001250744991907988, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.018192216372360886, 0.0, 0.02359756631512054, 0.003168449652147567, 0.018635756194487763, 0.013154628784531509, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.009993692744720348, 0.0, 0.0016909222297130033, 0.000996120935266644, 0.0007944694479043142, 0.0, 0.0, 0.006945378098337636, 0.0018861349164053243, 0.0014974981662362983, 0.0, 0.008710843471621226, 0.026537499532437826, 0.10256780356888051, 0.005081022931099788]]"

We can't make rent, so we window-shop In the Upper West Side, oh, my God Could you imagine that?  I won't be alone for the rest of my life I'll build a boat for when the river gets high And I'll meet a girl in the heat of July And I'll tell her so she knows That I'm broke, but I'm real rich in my head That I broke a bone that never healed in my hand So, when I hold her close I might loosen my grip, but I won't ever let her go I won't ever let her go  When forever was a sentence, sentence to death Oh, when you were a running tear, I was a drop of sweat And the edges of your soul, I haven't seen yet Now I'm glad I get forever to see where you end To see where you end","[[0.007723630334741101, 0.0, 0.0021396816994721894, 0.003748367205949588, 0.004104222283735819, 0.0, 0.004199987405248204, 0.0031953458094985693, 0.0036158332191730223, 0.0, 0.024500211096651014, 0.0, 0.008297163591196954, 0.008437280486682472, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003610004617183074, 0.004189537754808267, 0.009526454010612306, 0.0, 0.004598151066134621, 0.0065595703556365174, 0.002387477366748337, 0.0020245404717699578, 0.006215798296971595, 0.0, 0.0009548437503742651, 0.0, 0.0076416840706961114, 0.0, 0.006235850243596173, 0.0032212318169675853, 0.0026255426610326156, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0069684233638263446, 0.005426931919122462, 0.0033615624975603525, 0.0, 0.016969280469646793, 0.010769934365500505, 0.004083632935073228, 0.0028942305026234713, 0.0036916204639650904, 0.0030331712921153036, 0.0008013210010931637, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00124525699301945, 0.025746748572021295, 0.008695406505708285, 0.0, 0.0020011848579917966, 0.005390916512336964, 0.005751763371939137, 0.00926242135262037, 0.010315639860592064, 0.011103677758300574, 0.004885617694802435, 0.013887248069459105, 0.005038355465016898, 0.0, 0.0035817854697889825, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005616802069240046, 0.010584003916677567, 0.02221765482689324, 0.0, 0.0020011060004407927, 0.0019045096224248146, 0.0030127590089317146, 0.0036503928220737547]]"

Noah Kahan,No Complaints,"32 ContributorsNo Complaints Lyrics I thought I had something And that's the same as having something I get mad at nothing, blame my dad for something I pull no punches, then feel bad for months Mm, thought I was raised better, tried to fake better Tried to blame weather and escape better Hope the skin heals where the pain enters  Oh, but I finally got sewed up I set a time, then I showed up And, now, the weight of the world ain't so bad Mm-mhm  I saw the nd, it looks just like the middle I got a papr and pen and a page with no space I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication And forgot how to cry Who am I to complain?  And now the pain's different It still exists, it just escapes different And evades vision, makes the rain different Makes the news boring, and my rage distant Yes, I'm young and living dreams In love with being noticed And afraid of being seen But I can finally eat And I can fall asleep It's fine, fine, fine  I finally got sewed up I set a time, then I showed up And, now, the weight of the world ain't that bad  Well, I saw the end, it looks just like the middle I got a paper and pen and a page with no space I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication Then forgot how to cry, who am I, who am I to complain?  To complain Oh, oh-oh, oh To complain  I saw the end, it looked just like the middle I got a paper and pen, but I can't feel the pain I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication Then forgot how to cry Who am I to complain?","[[0.0172025788453845, 0.03576285371045976, 0.0, 0.010145505579902207, 0.002979550818785848, 0.007863674177274413, 0.005182089738558926, 0.007609900605799459, 0.0, 0.004197748256773332, 0.007326919206499996, 0.001990558578396994, 0.021769154457293095, 0.017212922944154, 0.0, 0.012552037211803391, 0.007083274022835348, 0.0085732205801231, 0.007668017023121067, 0.0014805339041278644, 0.024045175844581306, 0.008738936369452853, 0.009621849366165615, 0.0, 0.0285142772298362, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00755786993999336, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003302157185056146, 0.0016382593828340704, 0.013389565625273976, 0.0, 0.00899167831354056, 0.026305259789412505, 0.010200181711972576, 0.009823800766592805, 0.0, 0.011840679145559592, 0.0, 0.03450450182721385, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008544661898297999, 0.004424603285570746, 0.0, 0.0080691980120098, 0.006447726022808427, 0.012241813928505126, 0.0034404713386378878, 0.03318653679791622, 0.0, 0.0, 0.006890654765415498, 0.012103212797067569, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0071591458301460895, 0.013078756753081204, 0.02001632140609247, 0.012225601396416319, 0.010114410564868531, 0.00885700797054121, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.007752991504532132, 0.0029862443266844454, 0.02318807890408504, 0.0, 0.007756060334991645, 0.006634861266689725, 0.0, 0.008666576637713247]]"

A box of rain will ease the pain And love will see you through  Just a box of rain, wind, and water Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on Sun and shower, wind and rain In and out the window like a moth before a flame  And it's just a box of rain I don't know who put it there Believe it if you need it Or leave it if you dare And it's just a box of rain Or a ribbon for your hair Such a long long time to be gone And a short time to be there","[[0.006509889800356456, 0.01493026333568203, 0.0025693854526666585, 0.011130044284633362, 0.010952088100946578, 0.006079446413610571, 0.004215602197746931, 0.005396025761235393, 0.0038022934266262244, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0009535064574575074, 0.00390930921480739, 0.013459769193231266, 0.0, 0.006003321908054318, 0.006585237119036674, 0.005136666689429426, 0.002939263331721495, 0.004944544626525153, 0.010002982661768465, 0.0, 0.022135388682304247, 0.014912705926134718, 0.0, 0.0, 0.018632982293886335, 0.0, 0.0, 0.023669881820012815, 0.010228307724084973, 0.007847110843791085, 0.005104822998197251, 0.0, 0.002039745756569986, 0.009584872052037393, 0.002717218983714484, 0.007942851880465845, 0.0, 0.003508075845123568, 0.0, 0.09062341789036331, 0.0, 0.008094955273547753, 0.0016666504013057198, 0.001970959315999665, 0.0, 0.007521044422682651, 0.0, 0.01356193214342174, 0.0017031947578028627, 0.007076838557902202, 0.007631620836179836, 0.005636452807491789, 0.006130304254529886, 0.005985813511478748, 0.015591971561623156, 0.0, 0.009999884062497227, 0.005537175637997314, 0.003134600729245377, 0.0013111994523984233, 0.0015870315430091448, 0.0020788360601358353, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0073837295206815754, 0.0008397019807933124, 0.005513821849886725, 0.0, 0.0031896747879452798, 0.005199792567547475, 0.01455372879612078, 0.009781441541338564]]"

HARDY,ONE BEER,"15 ContributorsONE BEER Lyrics 17 in a small town Weak knees in a CVS Door locked in the bathroom What's it gonna be waitin' on that test? Never thought that they'd be Puttin' those life plans on the shelf A couple American babies raisin' one up their self  One beer turns into a lit cigarette Burnin' into a two beer buzz Three beers turns into five and six Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck Just like that, everything rearranges Life changes out of the blue It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny What one beer can turn into?

That makes you question your life What is it about me? That makes you question your life And lets you make me question mine  I hate when you call her up Just to talk about your little job And I hate when you make amends As if you've done absolutely nothing And Im sorry if I'm holding on too tight I know I'm not that sweet But do I ever hurt you  What What is it about me? That makes you question your life What is it about me?

Talking Heads,Life During Wartime,"56 ContributorsLife During Wartime Lyrics Heard of a van that's loaded with weapons Packed up and ready to go Heard of some gravesites out by the highway A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I've lived all over this town  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now  Transmit the message to the receiver Hope for an answer some day I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime I might not ever get home  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around This ain't no Mudd Club or C.B.G.B.  I ain't got time for that now  Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.? You oughta know not to stand by the window Somebody see you up there I got some groceries, some peanut butter To last a couple of days But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones Ain't got no records to play  Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard I ain't got time for that now  Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock We blended in with the crowd We got computers, we're tapping phone lines I know that that ain't allowed We dress like students, we dress like housewives Or in a suit and a tie I changed my hairstyle so many times now I don't know what I look like  You make me shiver, I feel so tender We make a pretty good team Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving You ought to get you some sleep Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won't help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace The burning keeps me alive Get your instructions, follow directions","[[0.0016658131324915398, 0.00863201297073775, 0.0051199647931373885, 0.0058506253915692275, 0.0030692951638325236, 0.0011820932387488737, 0.001296580757526688, 0.0017865052788648677, 0.0011510030701575686, 0.00217564208992541, 0.00038296333799620893, 0.0008196178668113071, 0.007720688207058832, 0.004488088175403308, 0.0, 0.0027856142003255084, 0.004333352132582596, 0.0, 0.007632787343715034, 0.0024773906342178613, 0.023063942285203157, 0.0004459808020091398, 0.008336546770175781, 0.0, 0.006326715683527387, 0.0, 0.01709554611181397, 0.0, 0.0009153438422603428, 0.005942663370808151, 0.03238777640619563, 0.0, 0.008252745589106138, 0.0, 0.006707990726526825, 0.006636138552221858, 0.004491361171344446, 0.0033744890506303554, 0.0, 0.003706390365830676, 0.003178855552706678, 0.008217175277503581, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0020726840895796974, 0.0002964862100581637, 0.0, 0.0035706419067257716, 0.0018584240687274955, 0.0032745747234536097, 0.004666461307022932, 0.004167314085191254, 0.0012874214015455774, 0.0019925966867916983, 0.002925266710020111, 0.00873938668170361, 0.0029239907252125194, 0.0, 0.0035351493861023983, 0.0035620303080421195, 0.001235597456343697, 0.003936309656524153, 0.0, 0.007137940556425897, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0016328780348309172, 0.0, 0.0007178711883936525, 0.0, 0.00454138304703494, 0.0005830725015979471, 0.0, 0.006032669557576759]]"

Creed,What If,"21 ContributorsWhat If Lyrics I can't find the rhyme in all my reason Lost sense of time and all seasons Feel I've been beaten down By the words of men who have no grounds Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom When your ax has cut the roots that feed them Forked tongues in bitter mouths Can drive a man to bleed from inside out  What if you did? What if you lied? What if I avenge? What if eye for an eye?  I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind Human pride sings a vengeful song Inspired by the times you've been walked on My stage is shared by many millions Who lift their hands up high because they feel this We are one, we are strong The more you hold us down, the more we press on  What if you did? What if you lied? What if I avenge? What if eye for an eye?  I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question I'll just ask one question What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?  What if you did? What if you lied? What if I avenge?

Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly Be God's glow  We could fly so high Let our spirits never die In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers Create a world with no fear Together, we'll cry happy tears See the nations turn their swords into plowshares  We could really get there If you cared enough for the living Make a little space To make a better place  Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place for you and for me Heal the world Make it a better place (Better place) For you and for me and the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for the living Make a better place for you and for me Heal the world (Heal the world) Make it a better place (Better place) For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no) There are people dying (Oh) If you care enough for the living Make a better place for you and for me  (Yeah) There are people dying (Oh) If you care enough for the living (Then) Make a better place for you and for me (Everyone, there are) There are people dying (Oh) If you care enough for the living Make a better place for you and for me  (You and for me) Make a better place (You and for me) Make a better place (You and for me) Make a better place (You and for me) Heal the world we live in (You and for me) Save it for our children (You and for me) Heal the world we live in (You and for me) Save it for our children (You and for me) Heal the world we live in (You and for me) Save it for our children (You and for me) Heal the world we live in (You and for me) Save it for our children","[[0.028258785958875647, 0.05689938790101997, 0.028578642446624544, 0.018571099542234886, 0.022384210902830895, 0.0065629904061672234, 0.001872784907470397, 0.007026841174263662, 0.0015883767931832286, 0.0018199292072717365, 0.0020749253535235473, 0.006128200942678516, 0.023583394958781426, 0.010113257546570768, 0.0026753397537353308, 0.022787328175021163, 0.004636219207853053, 0.03712818669315317, 0.002240786552320965, 0.0008286092036118779, 0.024044678596652692, 0.021635064211822402, 0.03613582216280534, 0.004119408781288816, 0.03176532448605197, 0.009715339344423628, 0.002457083984289713, 0.01358694258693266, 0.0012607091686115729, 0.0, 0.007084264533493208, 0.0018191460999663195, 0.016165901626212602, 0.0, 0.006277187630528718, 0.015082670958840614, 0.011110938754104197, 0.003617696032928542, 0.0, 0.005269702378727495, 0.0031672296178252585, 0.022348384604532794, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04375014172402704, 0.014982714530494075, 0.002960578221260473, 0.009523466644689137, 0.02450700002640413, 0.004477191293213341, 0.005288614299689651, 0.061888699889250234, 0.005112630634337988, 0.05270041981064961, 0.0020555301691943815, 0.0326738990470208, 0.0, 0.0010642197698147043, 0.004053646131974375, 0.03257996956587386, 0.0078044831110566995, 0.030789921360608936, 0.0041317627905260905, 0.01504162347724749, 0.015649522572219438, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003802845945969407, 0.0006150555834889435, 0.05119903863203966, 0.0, 0.005486332602601883, 0.0021181050318220557, 0.0007360919446899677, 0.02331685000214013]]"

Jelly Roll,Same Asshole,"16 ContributorsSame Asshole Lyrics Forgive me I've been drinkin', backroadin' and thinkin' Rememberin' the band played on while the ship sinkin' No matter what I do there's no escapin' my past I do everything I can and it keeps chasin' my ass I know my karma is constant for all the hearts that I broke Knowin' I'll never be forgiven, that shit bothers my soul When it's thrown up in my face, man that shit fucks up my day No matter what I do, I feel I'm only judged by mistakes Even if the good outweighs it by a million to one They still gon' hate me for the single fuckin' thing that I done Even if the good outweighs it by a million to one They still gon' hate me for that single fuckin' thing that I done (Thing that I done)  I try not to think of hard times I try hard to let the past go I thank God that I'm a changed man But somedays I'm that same asshole The same old me, the same backroads A couple of crosses and a black rose Singin' the same old sad song  I must admit I'm infatuated with sad clowns I guess they help me better understand my Dad now Those that entertain at the expense of pain Those that dance in the rain instead of just complain My brother always said I was ahead of the game Even before the fuckin' money hit, the jealousy came Put it all on the line, there's no regrets in this shit I admit besides the blessings there was lessons in it They said life is a marathon, tighten up 'cause you gotta run I know that the dollar spends as fast as the dollar comes Why these other rap dudes in the strip club with a lot of ones? I'm just tryin' to buy a crib and start my kids a college fund, for real  I try not to think of hard times I try hard to let the past go I thank God that I'm a changed man But somedays I'm that same asshole The same old me, the same backroads A couple of crosses and a black rose Singin' the same old sad songs  Can I be real for a minute? Release this passion within My fat ass gettin' bigger, I need to get back to the gym I'm lookin' at myself like how the fuck this happened again? Baby-Mama got out of jail and she done relapsed again I swear I'm tellin y'all the truth, there's so much shit in the air My father got leukemia, he just left critical care Not to mention mama's got dementia, man, she's always feelin' sick I try to help her pay the rent but she's unhappy as it gets I cannot complain because my daughter's doin' great Plus this music shit's a dream, what the fuck you think it ain't? But please make no mistake, baby after the show I'm all alone on this road headin' back to my home  I try not to think of hard times I try hard to let the past go I thank God that I'm a changed man But somedays I'm that same asshole The same old me, the same backroads A couple of crosses and a black rose Singin' the same old sad songs","[[0.0035429058111015295, 0.019917962754389774, 0.017025097170345286, 0.003731715073483343, 0.004702648341970269, 0.0012645147394664737, 0.01635307417955927, 0.014857222204690209, 0.0012441514566032326, 0.0069551055807640875, 0.0004655665752127099, 0.0014931597859941686, 0.021309339828446405, 0.009213402137128226, 0.0, 0.0033706363436434975, 0.002392862655511135, 0.0029138250460460854, 0.007311030520811272, 0.004402610302521905, 0.02559712019740658, 0.004970643866579213, 0.03168909755606334, 0.0, 0.0013389830563343514, 0.0013011082016750881, 0.002761256638567515, 0.008142536553955047, 0.0011116662162895196, 0.002276339544813314, 0.005974281095671761, 0.010383293154974094, 0.010534067103095611, 0.0, 0.005979276490810132, 0.004735257236850939, 0.008283021362071435, 0.005340205031184454, 0.00753917112961844, 0.012488640594622616, 0.0, 0.02639951143940003, 0.003014848110679023, 0.0007574742091929909, 0.0026790156176122112, 0.004264755578966333, 0.0, 0.0050437572773031365, 0.00858421051411492, 0.00959217584721533, 0.003955036862078088, 0.00828564941874084, 0.004504566013125697, 0.01367105564367771, 0.009744193306268318, 0.0137034603315355, 0.011782855506964628, 0.0, 0.002610690200168514, 0.013077442333301315, 0.03858368898098026, 0.009194710963495053, 0.0012135440611823155, 0.009766285059101907, 0.0011012294434933263, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008847136942946478, 0.00024183780722564398, 0.0071693922901396616, 0.0, 0.0038171698940710165, 0.0021126295196828284, 0.005617890828642712, 0.006707172898708751]]"

She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool  My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things? You're still the same old girl you used to be  You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes  There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes","[[0.010512926909229853, 0.013829325547849838, 0.008020581566357803, 0.009443323998343788, 0.006001419856290309, 0.007614216273547285, 0.023454047476203353, 0.0033251935425942193, 0.0023980178284321685, 0.00048089434769094217, 0.003493785347811395, 0.0008387613177909036, 0.005594168824848102, 0.017271962978603603, 0.0, 0.007505090261646323, 0.0070651704020412, 0.003962692516056695, 0.01106281989548175, 0.0010705299256716363, 0.01585113979643079, 0.006049963340270111, 0.007932167766413258, 0.007732545076700884, 0.005269104868377148, 0.005401544762809213, 0.001031969068913973, 0.008102587854305184, 0.011969316122131857, 0.0, 0.030930219761335066, 0.01044355000725401, 0.011101783925675733, 0.001145753385261013, 0.0022959252893370433, 0.025156456827983818, 0.0009361883882430582, 0.010951173890801151, 0.0, 0.014640832362268992, 0.007667203083862841, 0.027184348231392853, 0.007936063694634133, 0.0, 0.0017770441762598732, 0.01172348361125003, 0.0, 0.004040824434473514, 0.0018282366547383033, 0.011628588735730486, 0.019880552547822682, 0.016497279971320913, 0.0027621109480984764, 0.006024334131567171, 0.003138165685472546, 0.011511732716550132, 0.0027843672528408297, 0.0, 0.008701038366114196, 0.0062631942176574725, 0.012628399134479265, 0.009139733747253357, 0.0, 0.002018323480773774, 0.002250469383565825, 0.0, 0.0, 0.011318194588326566, 0.0011637280873230862, 0.0024136236264701272, 0.004643542849414916, 0.009728875821350774, 0.013698154572275257, 0.003883503751251988, 0.01107422897490145]]"

And when you're looking for your freedom (Nobody seems to care) And you can't find the door (Can't find it anywhere) When there's nothing to believe in Still you're coming back, you're running back You're coming back for more  So put me on a highway And show me a sign And take it to the limit one more time  Take it to the limit Take it to the limit Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Wee-ee) Take it to the limit (C'mon) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Wee-ee) Take it to the limit (You gotta) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit Take it to the limit Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Wee-ee) Take it to the limit (Come on and) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Ah-ah) Take it to the limit (Ah-ah) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit Take it to the limit","[[0.022644506820880293, 0.03156613968621456, 0.007015473534064087, 0.00490772732224304, 0.0013671532488212092, 0.0, 0.0034543060155820676, 0.0026099601753152785, 0.001608805178393362, 0.0, 0.007399262907848113, 0.015347589821791408, 0.016042419774867346, 0.009530754975870179, 0.0, 0.02088635914817682, 0.005786876501948904, 0.0021712066877343393, 0.035914479351931046, 0.006362840647078793, 0.062353350416485806, 0.02443981469595609, 0.013805482062189893, 0.021011874314324358, 0.006035886497832936, 0.0019313669237793801, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005013373677091633, 0.0, 0.025056063489921326, 0.0020013507091537703, 0.002941750064285119, 0.0, 0.0, 0.013081387694650707, 0.019527161550331965, 0.030434759057873892, 0.0, 0.014040068405786992, 0.0, 0.06672702920725314, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0029050810414745815, 0.0, 0.009747762345197152, 0.0, 0.012113607202258663, 0.014565897049656738, 0.004728671453671808, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0046867147724226205, 0.014987115195401376, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.017291796767619105, 0.0011606349471637717, 0.02252580441157704, 0.0, 0.018135578103836522, 0.0025935504690925482, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0029617626178193635, 0.0010897285370728299, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00513594609084384, 0.0012499369020999276, 0.009040624764315733, 0.012330119671396229]]"

Cody Johnson,Cowboy Like Me,"5 ContributorsCowboy Like Me Lyrics I got to thinking about all the stuff we worry about and I realized that All that a man really needs Is a horse you can catch when you need him A dog that'll come when you call A good friend who owns an arena And a trailer that's legal to haul A woman who'll share my frustrations When the cow market's falling apart A pair of good spurs, a saddle that fits And a one-ton Ford pick-up that starts Everything else is window-dressing  I'm out here chasin' these rainbows that I need to find I go and Lord knows it kills me to leave her behind She drew a low card when she gave me her heart And sometimes it's hard to believe That sweet little angel went and got herself tangled In the arms of a cowboy like me  Well, I know she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights Smoky bars and guitars don't make for no fairytale life And every time I head home, I think I'll find her gone But she's still there and still wants to be In the arms of a cowboy like me  She's worn a hole in the carpet between the bed and the phone She worries about me when I leave 'til I'm back home 'Cause there's downtime for killin' There's whiskey and there's women That's just right for fillin' a need Oh, but she's in no danger There's no room for a stranger In the arms of a cowboy like me  I know she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights Smoky bars and guitars don't make for no fairytale life Every time I head home, I think I'll find her gone But she's still there and still wants to be In the arms of a cowboy like me  Yeah, every time I head home, I think I'll find her gone But she's still there and still wants to be In the arms of a cowboy like me In the arms of a cowboy like me A cowboy like me","[[0.003076576054470968, 0.04422042757820121, 0.01906242298015116, 0.030090497518161227, 0.0071197606502716015, 0.00724901747886478, 0.0017513312220987, 0.0, 0.004986542917262103, 0.00438259531444406, 0.00651430975517316, 0.0, 0.024944730505337492, 0.012281987439782482, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00983330902208693, 0.014109407089267204, 0.06075154662034635, 0.00597893770699725, 0.0328108785351817, 0.013684088654639364, 0.024803764473784923, 0.024799503648849294, 0.02406600624754972, 0.0046014022346291365, 0.0073430846194006754, 0.0, 0.015534225490419796, 0.0, 0.020645109367265123, 0.013557708582838135, 0.03393783812498958, 0.0, 0.03192250340824141, 0.009324701191055041, 0.013571769277853918, 0.018145383934072654, 0.0, 0.04333497891625901, 0.010720738276327524, 0.0033013055786993125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005621713689379036, 0.0022561746566135436, 0.0, 0.002777307577507764, 0.0, 0.010966271863476313, 0.034549345502440584, 0.027082711321564465, 0.02556043562461192, 0.0036793115607755902, 0.004348066723330791, 0.027291514175350515, 0.0, 0.007491372404998571, 0.0, 0.004580126320797999, 0.0036704058588419215, 0.020414379345354713, 0.0, 0.01735447789700686, 0.003412988219478872, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0036877326719020557, 0.0033756148778278107, 0.022345788346621417, 0.0, 0.03183427332945985, 0.0038715572974771725, 0.013824663801049433, 0.016612708637581332]]"

And just like the rain You cast the dust into nothing And wash out the salt from my hands So touch me again I feel my shadow dissolving Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

Lord Huron,La Belle Fleur Sauvage,"21 ContributorsLa Belle Fleur Sauvage LyricsLa Belle Fleur Sauvage translates roughly to beautiful wildflower. Perfect analogy to the character named Lily who the main character is in love with. What you're looking for won't be found easily It grows upon the mountain in a sacred place Up beyond the clouds, in ancient ground, so they say And many men have died trekking up that way  Once he's gazed upon her, a man is forever changed The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain Ages come and go, but her life goes on the same She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain  Her colors change to mark the passing of the days No earthly sight can match the beauty she displays And when I die, I want her lying by my side In my grave, in my grave, oh  I'd give it all to love that girl I'll be the one to pluck that fleur  I'm meant to find the place where all good things begin To smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind And when I die, I want her lying by my side In my grave, in my grave   I'd give it all to love that girl I'll be the one to pluck that fleur I'd give it all to love that girl I'll be the one to pluck that fleur","[[0.06118906770382249, 0.07008376778103657, 0.0013245663224088426, 0.007590654329956784, 0.0009284183264639937, 0.002440631022694621, 0.006094117385455668, 0.0, 0.0013658986662386024, 0.0, 0.0017842957440108592, 0.010789729716865223, 0.005089112531101424, 0.006169623988859394, 0.0, 0.05433913938341834, 0.0029157932369808185, 0.004832921900120181, 0.011646755799573237, 0.0009177528669293108, 0.002707562218185725, 0.02157909282340051, 0.012263892262839166, 0.008579016053904773, 0.00512689832902488, 0.002506633968689033, 0.0047202793737592405, 0.004354181659003905, 0.004257741934057135, 0.004382231351394091, 0.0, 0.0028006954550183027, 0.0012861898578912189, 0.0, 0.004955910421001921, 0.005241098862995334, 0.0, 0.0032703913063389183, 0.0, 0.016063830866354437, 0.0, 0.0018478336857027404, 0.0019371517320538013, 0.0, 0.025694555662550383, 0.016755380899282857, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0035623034140293253, 0.006120968155223901, 0.01089456348080517, 0.008180998684790323, 0.0, 0.002000012700119511, 0.0019542132276050366, 0.0034546579118844376, 0.0, 0.0046867059439845435, 0.0022950633008889903, 0.04301817122053933, 0.006774330491778786, 0.004156417727693651, 0.0023372326453092156, 0.0015452324973666374, 0.002951456505814629, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0021639167783538684, 0.0035329997429672036, 0.0020698773361162866, 0.0, 0.0011157864022706622, 0.0010619311681602233, 0.0024859028425473872, 0.0042825514059329755]]"

Blake Shelton,God’s Country,"44 ContributorsGods Country Lyrics Right outside of this one church town There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin' Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground This is God's country We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen 'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money We put it back in the plate I guess that's why they call it God's country  I saw the light in a sunrise Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' Saved by the sound of the been found Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around This is God's country  We turn the dirt and work until the week's done We take a break and break bread on Sunday Then do it all again 'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)  I saw the light in a sunrise Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' Saved by the sound of the been found Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around This is God's country  (This is God's country) God's country  I don't care what my headstone reads Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in When it's my time, lay me six feet deep In God's country (Yeah)  I saw the light in a sunrise Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' Saved by the sound of the been found Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light) Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah) Saved by the sound of the been found Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around This is God's country","[[0.018171839265042893, 0.008667254452977745, 0.01805527854928546, 0.005841556320137548, 0.0, 0.0021003536505256174, 0.0027895064746979266, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0027166315884372726, 0.0, 0.0014068148597484158, 0.0063942187920820815, 0.0, 0.0, 0.000479405597022633, 0.0, 0.005956113191179793, 0.013626507749519283, 0.008410964775234554, 0.022610616055858634, 0.0031892571787447838, 0.004128590547967168, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0021549474757855446, 0.019798949742040686, 0.0, 0.00492252976781803, 0.001481777409749369, 0.0, 0.0011084629704395982, 0.0, 0.001543792001828338, 0.0011883448549671652, 0.0010739103486152213, 0.000987372901682626, 0.0, 0.0012924965927176453, 0.0028932121009885904, 0.0003275129070646969, 0.0, 0.002287587631944596, 0.0, 0.0014873631046392795, 0.0, 0.020921650386128515, 0.0, 0.0005687604243871153, 0.0028557477362136526, 0.001150910651060721, 0.029827435100864542, 0.0, 0.00047091110847440244, 0.0035756961202109646, 0.01102994926934951, 0.0, 0.006120871929145369, 0.0, 0.004098211199363932, 0.001150719919490267, 0.0, 0.003699233490139608, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.016962409615192586, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00949205377755134, 0.0, 0.011654488136697554]]"

Blake Shelton,Ol’ Red,"19 ContributorsOl Red Lyrics Well, I caught my wife with another man And it cost me ninety nine On a prison farm in Georgia Close to the Florida line Well, I'd been here for two long years I finally made the warden my friend And so he sentenced me to a life of ease Taking care of Ol' Red  Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail He's a four-legged trackin' machine You can consider yourself mighty lucky To get past the gators and the quicksand beds But all these years that I've been here Ain't nobody got past Red And the warden sang Come on somebody Why don't you run? Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun Get my lantern, get my gun Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes  Well, I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter To my cousin up in Tennessee Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound She was pretty as she could be Well they penned her up in the swampland 'Bout a mile just south of the gate And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run I'd just drop him off and wait And the warden sang Come on somebody Why don't you run? Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun Get my lantern, get my gun Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes  Now Ol' Red got real used to seein' His lady every night And so I kept him away for three or four days And waited till the time got right Well, I made my run with the evenin' sun And I smiled when I heard them let Red out 'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee And Ol' Red was headed south  And the warden sang Come on somebody Why don't you run? Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun Get my lantern, get my gun Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes  Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South Love got me in here and love got me out","[[0.0438015586688439, 0.04223344706947543, 0.0, 0.0009681987063497035, 0.00105471904933738, 0.0017756492277715842, 0.007804749123846719, 0.0029435911698541487, 0.001834737464429516, 0.0, 0.0019424173262084484, 0.00543376705949548, 0.021651708066008045, 0.0035512514762929452, 0.0, 0.03424619999186863, 0.0016943629356409398, 0.008618279523317878, 0.011907503500494854, 0.004598836984706842, 0.005332806952909372, 0.005185386071593674, 0.01674102309493858, 0.005490763663755633, 0.0025847238571709633, 0.015041792970545784, 0.003973797942800903, 0.0, 0.010798079679058338, 0.004480821738395016, 0.009015988570789566, 0.0011597244195254077, 0.005912871615111467, 0.0, 0.0013045708466389383, 0.0015535694023219345, 0.005062847320582781, 0.0017397917255811929, 0.0, 0.006807519303727264, 0.002797683254000253, 0.0016282289957766979, 0.0, 0.0026592560015095247, 0.0, 0.006833506318747391, 0.0, 0.0005213042219994984, 0.004867860766693048, 0.00928420932818176, 0.022107271548414974, 0.010262865164468915, 0.0, 0.006135974873586945, 0.00040248520937887747, 0.00555381385661219, 0.004681769164241583, 0.0, 0.0, 0.025978101937472357, 0.0007015491647643272, 0.003076275796468927, 0.0048777770259372695, 0.0015553744961797299, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00196494078923601, 0.0019712383311062767, 0.0, 0.0, 0.002488910115547545, 0.0011567706960208537, 0.0012531201644685722, 0.004944455813351933]]"
Blake Shelton,Sure Be Cool If You Did,"15 ContributorsSure Be Cool If You Did LyricsTheres a noticeable hip hop feel to this chart-topper.
