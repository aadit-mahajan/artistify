indeed most lasting romantic bonds do begin with nre although this does not mean that most relationships that begin with nre would lead to lasting romantic bonds because of the complications that can come with the end of nre only that the magnitude of these positive feelings is greater than it is likely to be later and some potential interpersonal problems may seem smaller than they will later

role in psychotherapy the scientific study of dreams is called oneirology most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function it is not known where in the brain dreams originate if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind the human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history long ago according to writings from mesopotamia and ancient egypt dreams dictated post

commands the dreamer to take specific actions and which may predict future events framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time dreaming and sleep are intertwined dreams occur mainly in the rapid eye movement rem stage of sleep when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake because rem sleep is detectable in many species and because research suggests that all mammals experience rem linking dreams to rem sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream however humans dream during non rem sleep also and not all rem awakenings elicit dream reports to

participants such that a situation that one considers to be a success another might consider to be a failure a qualified success or a neutral situation for example a film that is a commercial failure or even a box office bomb can go on to receive a cult following with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness it may also be difficult or impossible to

and broken down into more specific concepts and types that include cognitive empathy emotional or affective empathy somatic empathy and spiritual empathy empathy is still a topic of research the major areas of research include the development of empathy the genetics and neuroscience of empathy cross species empathy and the impairment of empathy some researchers have made efforts to quantify empathy through different methods such as from questionnaires where participants can fill out and then be scored on their answers the ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated process however the basic capacity to recognize emotions in others may be innate and may be achieved unconsciously empathy is not all or nothing rather a person can be more or less empathic toward another and empirical research supports a variety of interventions that are able to improve empathy the english word empathy is derived from the ancient greek \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1

characteristics including ways of thinking feeling and acting that humans are said to have naturally the term is often used to denote the essence of humankind or what it means to be human this usage has proven to be controversial in that there is dispute as to whether or not such an essence actually exists arguments about human nature have been a central focus of philosophy for centuries and the concept continues to provoke lively philosophical debate while both concepts are distinct from one another discussions regarding human nature are typically related to those regarding the comparative importance of genes and environment in human development i e nature versus nurture accordingly the concept also continues to play a role in academic fields such as both the natural and the social sciences and philosophy in which various theorists claim to have yielded insight into human nature human nature is traditionally contrasted with human attributes that vary among societies such as those associated with specific cultures the concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments is traditionally said to have begun in greek philosophy at least in regard to its heavy influence on western and middle eastern languages and perspectives by late antiquity and medieval times the particular approach that came to be dominant was that of aristotle s teleology whereby human nature was believed to exist somehow independently of individuals causing humans to simply become what they become this in turn has been understood as also demonstrating a special connection between human nature and divinity whereby human nature is understood in terms of final and formal causes more specifically this perspective believes that nature itself or a nature creating divinity has intentions and goals including the goal for humanity to live naturally such understandings of human nature see this nature as an idea or form of a human however the existence of this invariable and metaphysical human nature is subject of much historical debate continuing into modern times against aristotle s notion of a fixed human nature the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries firstly by early modernists such as thomas hobbes john locke and jean jacques rousseau in his emile or on education rousseau wrote we do not know what our nature permits us to be since the early 19th century such thinkers as darwin freud marx kierkegaard nietzsche and sartre as well as structuralists and postmodernists more generally have also sometimes argued against a fixed or innate human nature charles darwin s theory of evolution has particularly changed the shape of the discussion supporting the proposition that the ancestors of modern humans were not like humans today as in much of modern science such theories seek to explain with little or no recourse to metaphysical causation they can be offered to explain the origins of human nature and its underlying mechanisms or to demonstrate capacities for change and diversity which would arguably violate the concept of a fixed human nature", "Road trip": "a road trip sometimes spelled roadtrip is a long

intensity combined with an indistinct sensation of pleasure or pain occasioned or accompanied by some irregular movement of the blood and animal spirits are what we call passions they can be so strong as to inhibit all practice of personal freedom a state in which the soul is in some sense rendered passive whence the name passions this inclination or so called disposition of the soul is born of the opinion we hold that a great good or a great evil is contained in an object which in and of itself arouses passion diderot further breaks down pleasure and pain which he sees as the guiding principles of passion into four major categories pleasures and pains of the senses pleasures of the mind or of the imagination our perfection or our imperfection of virtues or vices pleasures and pains in the

and mental consequences the external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions body language physiological responses and at times public acts of aggression facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown while most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of what has happened to them psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self monitoring capacity and objective observability modern psychologists view anger as a normal natural and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times and as something that has functional value for survival uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well being and negatively impact those around them while many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger the issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers but modern psychologists in contrast to earlier writers have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger",

many of which consider it a core tenet of their philosophy some examples are faiths such as buddhism and christianity important figures like gandhi and throughout literature like perpetual peace a philosophical sketch by immanuel kant the art of peace by morihei ueshiba or ideologies that strictly adhere to it such as pacifism within a sociopolitical scope it is a frequent subject of symbolism and features prominently in art and other cultural traditions the representation of peace has taken many shapes with a variety of symbols pertaining to it based on culture context and history each with their respective symbolism whose nature can be very complex an example being during post violence in contexts where intense emotions these symbols can form to evoke unity and cooperation described as to fill groups of people with pride and connection yet the symbolism could also possibly form to convey oppression hatred or else as such a universal definition for peace does not concretely exist but gets expanded and defined proactively based on context and culture in which it can serve many meanings not particularly benevolent in its symbolism psychological peace such as peaceful thinking and emotions is less relatively well defined yet perhaps a necessary precursor to establishing behavioural peace peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a peaceful inner disposition it has been argued by some that inner qualities such as tranquility patience respect compassion kindness self control courage moderation forgiveness equanimity and the ability to see the big picture can promote peace within an individual regardless of the external circumstances of their life", "Optimism": "optimism is the attitude or mindset of expecting events to lead to particularly positive favorable desirable and hopeful outcomes a common idiom used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism is a glass filled with water to the halfway point an optimist is said to see the glass as half full while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty in ordinary english optimism may be synonymous with idealism often unrealistic or foolish optimism in particular the term derives from the latin optimum meaning best to be optimistic in the typical sense of the word is to expect the best possible outcome from any given situation this is usually referred to in psychology as dispositional optimism it reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best as a trait it fosters resilience in the face of stress theories of optimism include dispositional models and models of explanatory style methods to measure optimism have been developed within both of these theoretical approaches such as various forms of the life orientation test for the original dispositional definition of optimism and the attributional style questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style variation in optimism between people is somewhat heritable and reflects biological trait systems to some degree a person s optimism is also influenced by environmental factors including family environment and may be learnable optimism may also be related to health", "Pessimism": "pessimism is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general a common question asked to test for pessimism is is the glass half empty or half full in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty or in extreme cases completely empty while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full throughout history the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking", "Tradition": "a tradition is a system of beliefs or behaviors folk custom passed down within a group of people or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past a component of cultural expressions and folklore common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes like lawyers wigs or military officers spurs but the idea has also been applied to social norms and behaviors such as greetings etc traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years the word tradition itself derives from the latin word tradere literally meaning to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping while it is reportedly assumed that traditions have an ancient history many traditions have been invented on purpose whether it be political or cultural over short periods of time various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways the phrase according to tradition or by tradition usually means that what follows is known only through oral tradition and is not supported and might even be refuted by solid evidence here tradition describes the source or nature of the information for example according to tradition homer was born on chios but many other places have historically claimed him as theirs this tradition may never be proven or disproved another example is king arthur according to history a true british king has inspired many well loved stories whether the claims are supported by evidence or not does not reduce their value as cultural history and literature traditions are subject of study in several academic fields of learning especially in the humanities and social sciences including anthropology archaeology history and sociology the conceptualization of tradition as the notion of holding on to a previous time is also found in political and philosophical discourse for example it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism and also strands of many world religions including traditional catholicism in artistic contexts tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form for example in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer s own preferences a host of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization globalization and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups in response to this tradition preservation attempts and initiatives have now been started in many countries around the world focusing on aspects such as traditional languages tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts"}
