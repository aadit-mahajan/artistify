Jon Pardi,Night Shift,"58 ContributorsTranslationsEspaolNight Shift Lyrics The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit I mistakenly called them by your name I was let down, it wasn't the same I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one-track mind Regaining my self-worth in record time But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth? Call you a bitch and leave? Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet? What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?  I feel no need to forgive, but I might as well But let me kiss your lips, so I know how it felt Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down Walk for hours in the dark, feeling all hell  Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best You don't deserve what you don't respect Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young Take back what you said Can't lose what you never had  I feel no need to forgive, but I might as well But let me kiss your lips, so I know how it felt Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down Walk for hours in the dark, feeling all hell  You got a 9-to-5, so I'll take the night shift And I'll never see you again, if I can help it In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers Dedicated to new lovers  You got a 9-to-5, so I'll take the night shift And I'll never see you again, if I can help it In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers Dedicated to new lovers  You got a 9-to-5, so I'll take the night shift And I'll never see you again, if I can help it In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers Dedicated to new lovers","[[0.004050213786634385, 0.010278678763940218, 0.004108109105650353, 0.0017267247516044918, 0.0, 0.004133363668566612, 0.017820719343874556, 0.0025615856035441165, 0.0, 0.001235001242323812, 0.0, 0.0009402416807464121, 0.017926142079653044, 0.0067160595138889695, 0.0, 0.007975626277783036, 0.002537657019965673, 0.002131247839951969, 0.005961795678730735, 0.0, 0.009714392538882313, 0.0011025680416330741, 0.002608638736083906, 0.0, 0.020031375406043186, 0.015026319338684781, 0.0008296995805547455, 0.0, 0.001252270913301746, 0.0, 0.018551576098431194, 0.0029609796488618586, 0.0034588219126147008, 0.0017683543724944784, 0.001145039880818399, 0.004216950830266661, 0.002689320152370405, 0.003550562355235811, 0.0019193235773888803, 0.007225607611934745, 0.0007860998910500787, 0.004597341565769777, 0.0005922245417519492, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00263663381148996, 0.0, 0.0016268705168370943, 0.0, 0.008335913902652805, 0.00895689399821015, 0.009243872273819306, 0.0, 0.0009326094772903459, 0.0027640712887444636, 0.0034730363543305923, 0.0, 0.0, 0.011283638001077281, 0.0060194753862205805, 0.0024818835391166075, 0.00428020518838955, 0.0007156676999228857, 0.004377358484284265, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0005426819749324037, 0.0020541020242005495, 0.0, 0.002185691614079927, 0.0018705994537502545, 0.0016268293915832441, 0.006432682892470483]]"

Brandon Lake,COAT OF MANY COLORS,"27 ContributorsCoat of Many Colors Lyrics Back through the years I go wandering once again Back to the seasons of my youth I recall a box of rags that someone gave us And how my mama put the rags to use  There were rags of many colors, every piece was small And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of  As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss  My coat of many colors that my mama made for me Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors my mama made for me  So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me In my coat of many colors my mama made for me  But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes  But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see That one is only poor only if they choose to be Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors my mama made for me Made just for me","[[0.029703231328347353, 0.03635743123414374, 0.002049449192188234, 0.0027906087722516645, 0.003064445175916736, 0.0, 0.0026621636186248323, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01235627966083978, 0.003283680208473235, 0.004280652821516503, 0.0, 0.030603911129644192, 0.0, 0.0032502115630936505, 0.00560084211819631, 0.0009265527512811858, 0.003921373792302069, 0.00557558897255929, 0.0016346111502554884, 0.0018531792117669654, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.004119073029194838, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00098511092904044, 0.003123714420712519, 0.0, 0.006933072049405937, 0.0036771383069973945, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.001597640730362281, 0.0, 0.0007642871852928777, 0.004416483955237604, 0.0029291097165478138, 0.024464166692216315, 0.0038089467358504692, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0011729104415488167, 0.008598320241571675, 0.009249144783195561, 0.0, 0.0015467595741568956, 0.0037221635753102943, 0.00617049190810252, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0035457313922412563, 0.024944304962117816, 0.0034833595692572283, 0.020391540814902614, 0.003923089084151569, 0.001417877214061631, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.006835327144618347, 0.0, 0.004182030760785273, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0015791655636010608, 0.007410470757688935, 0.009076348093336788]]"

Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss? Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs? Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on  Well, if you're anything like me You just might be doing whatever it takes To outrun the storm But I'm almost out that door  And I'm one number away From calling to you I said I was through But I'm dying, inside Got my head in a mess Girl, I confess I lied when I said ""I'm leaving and not coming back"" Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go, I see your face In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say But I'm still one number away  Will you pick up when I call?

Luke Combs,Better Together,"30 ContributorsTranslationsFranaisDeutschBetter Together LyricsThis is the first track on Jacks album In Between Dreams which was released in February 2005. The song samples some from Heart and Soul by Hoagy Carmichael. There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart Our dreams and they are made out of real things Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard? It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together  Mmm, it's always better when we're together Yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together Well, it's always better when we're together Yeah, it's always better when we're together  And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now  Yeah, it's always better when we're together Mmm, we're somewhere in between together Well, it's always better when we're together Yeah, it's always better when we're together  Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm  I believe in memories They look so, so pretty when I sleep And I when, and when I wake up You look so pretty, sleeping next to me But there is not enough time And there is no, no song I could sing And there is no combination of words I could say But I will still tell you one thing We're better together","[[0.018099888201237313, 0.05309366285676088, 0.0, 0.004775585978037561, 0.0024801877290997433, 0.0, 0.007315003894451744, 0.007939733825672058, 0.004094293481719021, 0.0, 0.0006119924116662998, 0.002648638763391777, 0.005795131272979578, 0.0009404695560873595, 0.0, 0.01669298882417539, 0.00947865172039247, 0.012091628951766124, 0.0008278626258903288, 0.0012560706214112655, 0.02450266713472769, 0.0008175948419703299, 0.012857825051972131, 0.010924354973749346, 0.0017592944392772194, 0.004731541872460161, 0.0037260921141123236, 0.0, 0.001460830888448607, 0.005998210603355029, 0.009031686801915649, 0.00964332247693527, 0.011949403453094146, 0.0, 0.00423024883464739, 0.004914121532184441, 0.003185439998066732, 0.003147060983954663, 0.0, 0.010662308802262616, 0.0, 0.11876590208403695, 0.009562174037595223, 0.0, 0.015976834513435664, 0.00984430787573478, 0.0, 0.008786265610738109, 0.0007741551724938809, 0.008547377079161934, 0.0027548312610185996, 0.007590361464812914, 0.0, 0.0030297162431671245, 0.006109451369569546, 0.004432589693447283, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0031447451203420584, 0.012662782014310519, 0.01885973501992546, 0.014998782723886763, 0.0, 0.010898588491317949, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.010305428825058374, 0.002078247964965565, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0069928252406514626, 0.002384237281146841, 0.007460159665439452, 0.009598230198810866]]"

We gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this way So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged I had a feelin' I could be someone Be someone, be someone  You got a fast car We go cruisin', entertain ourselves You still ain't got a job And I work in a market as a checkout girl I know things will get better You'll find work and I'll get promoted And we'll move out of the shelter Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged I had a feelin' I could be someone Be someone, be someone  You got a fast car I got a job that pays all our bills You stay out drinkin' late at the bar See more of your friends than you do of your kids I'd always hoped for better Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere So take your fast car and keep on drivin'  So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged I had a feelin' I could be someone Be someone, be someone  You got a fast car Is it fast enough so you can fly away?

She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool  My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things? You're still the same old girl you used to be  You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes  There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes","[[0.010512926909229853, 0.013829325547849844, 0.008020581566357802, 0.009443323998343788, 0.006001419856290309, 0.007614216273547285, 0.023454047476203357, 0.0033251935425942197, 0.0023980178284321685, 0.00048089434769094217, 0.0034937853478113953, 0.0008387613177909036, 0.005594168824848102, 0.017271962978603603, 0.0, 0.007505090261646323, 0.0070651704020412015, 0.003962692516056695, 0.01106281989548175, 0.0010705299256716363, 0.015851139796430786, 0.006049963340270111, 0.00793216776641326, 0.007732545076700884, 0.005269104868377148, 0.0054015447628092145, 0.001031969068913973, 0.008102587854305182, 0.011969316122131857, 0.0, 0.030930219761335066, 0.01044355000725401, 0.011101783925675728, 0.0011457533852610128, 0.0022959252893370438, 0.02515645682798382, 0.0009361883882430578, 0.010951173890801151, 0.0, 0.014640832362268994, 0.007667203083862841, 0.02718434823139286, 0.007936063694634133, 0.0, 0.0017770441762598732, 0.01172348361125003, 0.0, 0.004040824434473514, 0.0018282366547383033, 0.011628588735730484, 0.019880552547822682, 0.01649727997132091, 0.0027621109480984764, 0.006024334131567171, 0.003138165685472546, 0.01151173271655013, 0.0027843672528408297, 0.0, 0.008701038366114196, 0.006263194217657472, 0.012628399134479265, 0.009139733747253357, 0.0, 0.002018323480773774, 0.002250469383565825, 0.0, 0.0, 0.011318194588326566, 0.0011637280873230862, 0.0024136236264701277, 0.004643542849414916, 0.009728875821350774, 0.013698154572275257, 0.0038835037512519885, 0.01107422897490145]]"

You've been out ridin' fences for so long now Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you got your reasons These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow  Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy She'll beat you if she's able You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet Now it seems to me some fine things Have been laid upon your table But you only want the ones that you can't get  Desperado, woah, you ain't gettin' no younger Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home And freedom, oh, freedom, well, that's just some people talkin' Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone  Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?

What is yours and what is mine? 'Cause there is no more new frontier But we have got to make it here We satisfy our endless needs And justify our bloody deeds In the name of destiny And in the name of God  And you can see them there On Sunday morning And stand up and sing about What it's like up there They call it paradise I don't know why You call someplace paradise Kiss it goodbye","[[0.003205790949635076, 0.02140301389885521, 0.008456416260027641, 0.009792177654234171, 0.013998072960872944, 0.0015397039291189588, 0.02003166725074261, 0.001959291837372944, 0.0010950889021552248, 0.003797980221469473, 0.0014305119108433304, 0.0, 0.005728300039297457, 0.005750695098452371, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0031206061013540625, 0.014416646585242604, 0.007185281715103633, 0.0007660096052606256, 0.010553272394548752, 0.01257137694342353, 0.013549437065779942, 0.001512444197723716, 0.016917974424999458, 0.001931391743474522, 0.005704353036055772, 0.0024649475481630027, 0.0, 0.0, 0.019381415434676308, 0.004894244509801589, 0.011838235022120669, 0.003964876394784013, 0.011737778084229787, 0.012959527172778406, 0.0023462740240486404, 0.009462973645615236, 0.0, 0.006746513384365281, 0.006968028968379594, 0.023667086418147108, 0.0017174245618518727, 0.0016713076044046465, 0.012383015313119564, 0.007226602630683493, 0.0, 0.002550250433872387, 0.006145841027156463, 0.004127779738162471, 0.005401141042849131, 0.025872549365792977, 0.0, 0.010764503347203832, 0.00034776207921382755, 0.017433852592385987, 0.0, 0.004155102447159608, 0.0065621628771481205, 0.003961474967284534, 0.006318859141360683, 0.0031613032635520867, 0.010489098197473743, 0.003369534533391919, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.007374968234216703, 0.002974999404888007, 0.013263390419640248, 0.0, 0.008922563643019235, 0.0008513943594916939, 0.0, 0.01139071126513737]]"
Eagles,Take It to the Limit,"32 ContributorsTake It to the Limit Lyrics All alone at the end of the evening When the bright lights have faded to blue I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have Loved me and I never knew You know I've always been a dreamer (Spent my life running 'round) And it's so hard to change (Can't seem to settle down) But the dreams I've seen lately Keep on turning out and burning out And turning out the same  So put me on a highway And show me a sign And take it to the limit one more time  You can spend all your time making money You can spend all your love making time If it all fell to pieces tomorrow Would you still be mine? And when you're looking for your freedom (Nobody seems to care) And you can't find the door (Can't find it anywhere) When there's nothing to believe in Still you're coming back, you're running back You're coming back for more  So put me on a highway And show me a sign And take it to the limit one more time  Take it to the limit Take it to the limit Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Wee-ee) Take it to the limit (C'mon) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Wee-ee) Take it to the limit (You gotta) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit Take it to the limit Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Wee-ee) Take it to the limit (Come on and) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit (Ah-ah) Take it to the limit (Ah-ah) Take it to the limit one more time Take it to the limit Take it to the limit","[[0.022644506820880296, 0.03156613968621456, 0.007015473534064087, 0.00490772732224304, 0.0013671532488212092, 0.0, 0.0034543060155820676, 0.0026099601753152785, 0.0016088051783933607, 0.0, 0.007399262907848113, 0.015347589821791411, 0.01604241977486735, 0.009530754975870175, 0.0, 0.020886359148176825, 0.005786876501948904, 0.0021712066877343397, 0.035914479351931046, 0.006362840647078792, 0.062353350416485806, 0.02443981469595609, 0.013805482062189893, 0.021011874314324358, 0.006035886497832936, 0.0019313669237793801, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005013373677091633, 0.0, 0.025056063489921326, 0.0020013507091537703, 0.002941750064285119, 0.0, 0.0, 0.013081387694650705, 0.019527161550331965, 0.030434759057873892, 0.0, 0.014040068405786992, 0.0, 0.06672702920725314, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0029050810414745815, 0.0, 0.009747762345197152, 0.0, 0.012113607202258663, 0.014565897049656737, 0.004728671453671808, 0.0, 0.0, 0.004686714772422621, 0.014987115195401376, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.017291796767619105, 0.0011606349471637717, 0.022525804411577036, 0.0, 0.018135578103836522, 0.0025935504690925482, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0029617626178193635, 0.0010897285370728299, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005135946090843842, 0.0012499369020999276, 0.009040624764315733, 0.012330119671396227]]"
Eagles,Best of My Love,"15 ContributorsBest of My Love LyricsBest of My Love was written by Don Henley, Glenn Frey and J.D. Souther. It was produced by Gyln Johns. According to J.D.

You see it your way And I see it mine But we both see it slippin' away (Ooh, ooh) You know we always had each other, baby (Ooh, ooh) I guess that wasn't enough  Oh-uh-oh, but here in my heart I give you the best of my love  Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling You get the best of my love (The best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling You get the best of my love (The best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling Ev'ry night and day You get the best of my love (The best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling Oh-oh, oh-oh (You get the best of my love) (The best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling You get the best of my love (The best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling Mm-mm-mm-mm-hmm You get the best of my love (You get the best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling (The best of my love) You got it, you got it You get the best of my love (You get the best of my love) Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling...","[[0.09165584861302169, 0.10598001457891683, 0.001263334827984376, 0.008512323970801447, 0.008835645338572095, 0.000858414325258689, 0.0022568064478541853, 0.0008450688556858313, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.013149454282007691, 0.0024736863145272655, 0.0067802459802867, 0.0, 0.08358328002006488, 0.0014218122500545254, 0.0012776353706154262, 0.002302992598338781, 0.0010796356240700899, 0.007192598459495644, 0.007366605279172857, 0.004790829984815825, 0.003918969355191708, 0.0, 0.0012378692033709734, 0.0006977644658423989, 0.003392084176713063, 0.0015346977998231778, 0.001123781638205289, 0.013533286128628544, 0.020859557332025727, 0.003482073995209863, 0.0, 0.0011847428015511058, 0.012772673353418968, 0.0016607730084266497, 0.0031512366307693677, 0.0, 0.0016807575136797827, 0.0, 0.02768170517393263, 0.000955845778883792, 0.0, 0.0026110521546883515, 0.0229039432653378, 0.0024608079950966676, 0.01420016254578473, 0.000559932275352521, 0.004379153384672732, 0.03653994937595576, 0.0018404351662820548, 0.0, 0.0006180564942024466, 0.00105352970605653, 0.009351285087905574, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0016357652852407526, 0.06390667315052272, 0.0005693008613628657, 0.002393872094609051, 0.0019383742974205993, 0.005304274693003305, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0020804297263337513, 0.00035948079260403635, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0014396650050916525, 0.029945094237881636, 0.003643292993688104, 0.020956999935614295]]"

I dream of crackin' locks Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox I'm seeing visions Am I bad or mad or wise?  What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind? One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze Oh, what a way to die I keep recalling things we never did Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts Without ever touchin' his skin How can I be guilty as sin?  I keep these longings lockd In lowercase, inside a vault Somone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts Only your actions talk"" These fatal fantasies Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me We've already done it in my head If it's make-believe Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?  What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind? One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze Oh, what a way to die My bed sheets are ablaze I've screamed his name Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave Without ever touchin' his skin How can I be guilty as sin?  What if I roll the stone away? They're gonna crucify me anyway What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?

I can see him there and hes sitting in the same ol' stool That I broke in when she broke me in two And looking back now, well, I reckon I owe him a round  So if you find a dive down in Cartersville, Georgia Theres a dude with a Bulldogs tattoo in the corner of the bar With a scar on his left eye; it's from a mean right hook of mine He got my girl and a few good licks in It broke my heart, but that was back then And I figured out later, well, he might have did me a favor So if you get that chance, wont you get that man a beer?

Megan Moroney,Third Time’s the Charm,"4 ContributorsThird Times the Charm Lyrics I fell in love at sweet sixteen Ain't never felt a cut that deep I blamed him and he blamed me I cried so hard I couldn't breathe So, I swore off love for quite sometime 'Til the bad boy took me for a ride And that went how you'd think it'd go And I said, ""I guess I'll die alone""  I got good at sleepin' by myself I got good at not needin' no one else  But now I think it's happenin' again You put a brand new kind of wind back in my sails Took my heart off of the shelf And you're not nothin' like I've known I'm already scared to let you go Tonight, I'm layin' in your arms Prayin' that the third time's the charm  You're patient and you're twice as kind And there's a book that says that's some good sign You calm my crazy every time You think I'm kind of crazy, but you don't mind  Now I think it's happenin' again You put a brand new kind of wind back in my sails Took my heart off of the shelf And you're not nothin' like I've known I'm already scared to let you go Tonight, I'm layin' in your arms Prayin' that the third time's the charm  Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh  I could probably get back up If this goes south and I lose your love But I don't wanna know a world Where you're not mine, and I'm not your girl  Baby, I think it's happenin' again You put a brand new kind of wind back in my sails Took my heart off of the shelf And you're not nothin' like I've known I'm already scared to let you go Tonight, I'm layin' in your arms Prayin' that the third time's the charm  Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh","[[0.05493204182800343, 0.12036708170696181, 0.037176258570952796, 0.015194120310576107, 0.004758927570085631, 0.007349051185483617, 0.04540122989182647, 0.0021111770047842816, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008026735114401459, 0.011104413782576332, 0.008441451975370592, 0.008699810303897567, 0.050669546989571816, 0.010792565240301186, 0.0, 0.0048356724133989636, 0.005507781268323301, 0.0709901923444423, 0.0, 0.013357214124084098, 0.0, 0.007212581673573762, 0.0, 0.017009650050981436, 0.008482769523560441, 0.0, 0.009066783489874648, 0.011696115787740335, 0.004288228578166333, 0.011917519018374694, 0.0, 0.026924005673193432, 0.01343692013349988, 0.008476698119713365, 0.0077936319637309575, 0.004134684282671702, 0.009945486730608478, 0.0, 0.0064869354803920925, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008775926057308928, 0.019943018915246472, 0.0, 0.007921480307646785, 0.0019044235561035512, 0.013392475882931104, 0.022941637457401385, 0.02141114642253093, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003717043338770676, 0.01556482962288187, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04683896226387581, 0.007418018363088802, 0.012010795168156074, 0.0, 0.027427370168837086, 0.004975970484424544, 0.0, 0.0, 0.014866629781319494, 0.0, 0.003031903061156139, 0.0, 0.010002014183027989, 0.0019469663717538383, 0.00913643109794308, 0.01748070263163703]]"

Megan Moroney,Break It Right Back,"4 ContributorsBreak It Right Back Lyrics Dressed to the nines, perfect blue eyes I looked around, not a red flag in sight My daddy liked you, and that was a first You promised him you'd be the guy I deserve  Oh, too good to be true Oh, we were wrong about you  You weren't supposed to be just like the rest You swore up and down that, you loved me to death Now we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex 'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less Oh, why does this happen every time? What's wrong with me? Am I that bad? You felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it Just to turn around, turn around And break it right back, break it right back  You knew my past and begged me to try To love again, because it'd end different this time But words are just words, and you're just a guy And I'm just the girl you looked at like a prize  You weren't supposed to be just like the rest You swore up and down that, you loved me to death Now we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex 'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less Oh, why does this happen every time? What's wrong with me? Am I that bad? You felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it Just to turn around, turn around And break it right back  So go use your fancy big words at your fancy big job Tell your friends how you're right and how I'm just so wrong And how you do it all, and I don't do enough How you can't settle down with a girl that lives on a tour bus  You weren't supposed to be just like the rest You swore up and down that, you loved me to death Now we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex 'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less Oh, why does this happen every time?

Bailey Zimmerman,Hell or High Water,"22 ContributorsHell Or High Water Lyrics Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark? Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts? Was it something I said, or just a cruel twist of fate? Was it hell or high water and is it too late? Oh, is it too late?  Man, all my life I've been searching for someone To show me how it feels to be loved, and How to love somebody back And after stumbling through the years, I Thought I found you just to See you fading out into the night  Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark? Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts? Was it something you said, or just a cruel twist of fate? Was it hell or high water and is it too late?  See, all my life I've been silently reaching for A hand to hold to warm the cold, spark a light To guide me through alright And after stumbling through the years I thought I found you, just to See you fading out into the night  Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark? Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts? Was it something we did, or just a cruel twist of fate? Was it hell or high water and is it too late?  Hey, hey Hey, hey  Was it a knife in my back or a fork in the road? Was it hell or high water that left us alone? Is it really game over? Is it really checkmate? Was it hell or high water and is it too late? Oh, is it too late?  Was it the trick of the light or a shot in the dark? Was it hell or high water that broke her heart?","[[0.004427437593191364, 0.007920969958512093, 0.0, 0.0018352655185188789, 0.0, 0.001108509400414181, 0.0007903482640847166, 0.0006663265737672146, 0.0005716809598089418, 0.0, 0.00074662369066528, 0.0006524131390161696, 0.0015931828122604979, 0.01065585917260087, 0.0, 0.00408044437990431, 0.00995445523330375, 0.002368372068055243, 0.008985984492802041, 0.0, 0.0022879923457022897, 0.0, 0.0065158922170193145, 0.0, 0.0021619970304075937, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0017911215008268354, 0.0, 0.02167277750612366, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008300548117372197, 0.0, 0.00397949154042352, 0.0, 0.008254307726091044, 0.015614467751015446, 0.004095198075740665, 0.0, 0.0017696151251622551, 0.0, 0.0028844388044539536, 0.0, 0.000694020363378766, 0.0, 0.00043210227828246827, 0.0005678864829807514, 0.0017213124643958913, 0.0, 0.0009068078747949716, 0.0004888153758655896, 0.007472779491677154, 0.0030744419365722965, 0.0, 0.0, 0.006353577145039437, 0.0077145818590250975, 0.0029209602728391066, 0.0, 0.004417811717407223, 0.0007702131382724554, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0007570428474716718, 0.0003910099438617264, 0.012635814263075498, 0.0, 0.00047035052751634064, 0.01049669030806843, 0.009230849917232982, 0.001780981766231354]]"

It tells the story of a greedy woman who is overly optimistic about her Read More   There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold And she's buying a stairway to Heaven When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed With a word, she can get what she came for Ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven  There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven  Ooh, it makes me wonder Ooh, makes me wonder  There's a feeling I get when I look to the west And my spirit is crying for leaving In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees And the voices of those who stand looking  Ooh, it makes me wonder Ooh, really makes me wonder  And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune Then the piper will lead us to reason And a new day will dawn for those who stand long And the forests will echo with laughter  Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-ho  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now It's just a spring clean for the May queen Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run There's still time to change the road you're on  And it makes me wonder Ohh, oh-oh  Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know The piper's calling you to join him Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

Kane Brown,Memory,"30 ContributorsMemory Lyrics Midnight, not a sound from the pavement Has the moon lost her memory? She is smiling alone In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet And the wind begins to moan  Memory, all alone in the moonlight I can smile at the old days I was beautiful then I remember the time I knew what happiness was Let the memory live again  Every streetlamp seems to beat A fatalistic warning Someone mutters and the streetlamp gutters And soon It will be morning  Daylight I must wait for the sunrise I must think of a new life And I mustn't give in When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too And a new day will begin  Burnt-out ends of smokey days The stale cold smell of morning The street lamp dies, another night is over Another day is dawning  Sunlight through the trees in summer Endless masquerading Like a flower, as the dawn is breaking The memory is fading  Touch me It's so easy to leave me All alone with my memory Of my days in the sun If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is Look, a new day has begun","[[0.0, 0.003975096935177572, 0.0037802072970783873, 0.0013662293607627416, 0.0029971507541599997, 0.0, 0.049794400832484695, 0.0, 0.0010000327233098693, 0.0, 0.01311415129428932, 0.004796665869431693, 0.0055986436513926355, 0.003010371835379555, 0.0, 0.006017927277752334, 0.008543993096854555, 0.0013496213003068075, 0.003317824985102983, 0.00808327830029626, 0.007616945079690206, 0.0026391982671036705, 0.024999847914287294, 0.0, 0.00375190488760429, 0.003680669511630722, 0.027376819335596346, 0.0023072939501151027, 0.0031163112840541375, 0.03859386091173933, 0.03084556337489895, 0.0, 0.01594154236868236, 0.0, 0.0016430329078683974, 0.0022319241315079522, 0.0013072626235236244, 0.0025070605074840836, 0.0, 0.01099946722546325, 0.0, 0.01094959384420719, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.006313807390313838, 0.0, 0.0007433687463529779, 0.0, 0.01642325129403455, 0.0009274779038975544, 0.00851841871638238, 0.0, 0.0, 0.002335869022722606, 0.005227960014158616, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00741614779986609, 0.0, 0.003664685881212687, 0.043146524184214254, 0.007434074818947705, 0.0022196182775794716, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0016996644784424138, 0.0006773748687741788, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003382149055063548, 0.0007769603311575534, 0.001819421109254724, 0.0022027633165230816]]"

Blake Shelton,Ol’ Red,"19 ContributorsOl Red Lyrics Well, I caught my wife with another man And it cost me ninety nine On a prison farm in Georgia Close to the Florida line Well, I'd been here for two long years I finally made the warden my friend And so he sentenced me to a life of ease Taking care of Ol' Red  Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail He's a four-legged trackin' machine You can consider yourself mighty lucky To get past the gators and the quicksand beds But all these years that I've been here Ain't nobody got past Red And the warden sang Come on somebody Why don't you run?

I'm just tryin' to buy a crib and start my kids a college fund, for real  I try not to think of hard times I try hard to let the past go I thank God that I'm a changed man But somedays I'm that same asshole The same old me, the same backroads A couple of crosses and a black rose Singin' the same old sad songs  Can I be real for a minute? Release this passion within My fat ass gettin' bigger, I need to get back to the gym I'm lookin' at myself like how the fuck this happened again? Baby-Mama got out of jail and she done relapsed again I swear I'm tellin y'all the truth, there's so much shit in the air My father got leukemia, he just left critical care Not to mention mama's got dementia, man, she's always feelin' sick I try to help her pay the rent but she's unhappy as it gets I cannot complain because my daughter's doin' great Plus this music shit's a dream, what the fuck you think it ain't? But please make no mistake, baby after the show I'm all alone on this road headin' back to my home  I try not to think of hard times I try hard to let the past go I thank God that I'm a changed man But somedays I'm that same asshole The same old me, the same backroads A couple of crosses and a black rose Singin' the same old sad songs","[[0.0035429058111015295, 0.019917962754389767, 0.01702509717034529, 0.003731715073483343, 0.004702648341970268, 0.0012645147394664737, 0.01635307417955927, 0.014857222204690209, 0.0012441514566032329, 0.0069551055807640875, 0.0004655665752127099, 0.0014931597859941688, 0.021309339828446405, 0.009213402137128226, 0.0, 0.0033706363436434975, 0.002392862655511135, 0.002913825046046085, 0.007311030520811274, 0.004402610302521905, 0.025597120197406585, 0.004970643866579213, 0.03168909755606334, 0.0, 0.0013389830563343514, 0.0013011082016750881, 0.002761256638567515, 0.008142536553955047, 0.0011116662162895196, 0.002276339544813314, 0.00597428109567176, 0.010383293154974094, 0.010534067103095611, 0.0, 0.005979276490810132, 0.004735257236850939, 0.008283021362071435, 0.005340205031184453, 0.007539171129618438, 0.012488640594622612, 0.0, 0.02639951143940003, 0.003014848110679023, 0.0007574742091929906, 0.0026790156176122112, 0.004264755578966333, 0.0, 0.0050437572773031365, 0.00858421051411492, 0.00959217584721533, 0.003955036862078089, 0.00828564941874084, 0.0045045660131256965, 0.01367105564367771, 0.009744193306268318, 0.0137034603315355, 0.011782855506964623, 0.0, 0.002610690200168514, 0.013077442333301315, 0.03858368898098026, 0.009194710963495051, 0.0012135440611823155, 0.009766285059101907, 0.0011012294434933263, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008847136942946478, 0.00024183780722564398, 0.0071693922901396616, 0.0, 0.0038171698940710165, 0.0021126295196828284, 0.005617890828642712, 0.006707172898708749]]"

ROSE,Then,"122 ContributorsMemories Back Then Lyrics Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow Still gave it up when it's a few of us She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus We used to cut school with her and run train She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang Just penetratin' that throat, dawg She choked on it like smoke, dawg But whenever I fucked up my re-up In a dice game I go see her She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce And then blow a blunt of that reefer She used to buy a nigga new sneakers Pay the bill on my beeper Just so she can page to put a ""69"" And I know it time to go freak her Then one day I just asked her ""Why you always give your ass up? I mean, damn, these hoes get paid All you do is get laidthis shit don't add up."" She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love Even if I know it ain't real love Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it And then never call back, I still fuck."" And that's fucked up, but she so trill I need somethin', she go steal When the trap hot and police ride Nigga, guess where we go chill? For 'bout four years she held dope And my four pounds 'til it go down I remember shawty, she stayed down I won't say her name cause she married now  When the lights go out And I'm in my bed I think of all the madness in my head All of the things that I did back then When I'm in my bed I think of all the memories I've had All of the things I did back then  She would always turn heads when she'd fall through She would always make moves how a boss do And she never gave any nigga time of day But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to But when it came to me, she had a thing for me When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady Watchin' just to see if the police comin' We got close over time, her and I Right around the time that I first got signed Come to think about it I was 'bout 17 I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive I was goin' back and forth with each flight Another show after show, each night She became so suspicious of these other bitches She'd go through my phone and we'd fight Talk about torn between the two Wasn't really much more that we could do Wasn't really much space for us But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do But I guess one night I had a few Huh, one night I had a few Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye I told her: ""Hurry up, meet me at the room!"" And no, I didn't have a contraceptive What my common sense neglected And two months later, next thing I know I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant"" And you can almost bet she kept it And that's the reason why you left me On top of all that, it wasn't even mine I went and got paternity testeddamn!  When the lights go out And I'm in my bed I think of all the madness in my head All of the things that I did back then When I'm in my bed I think of all the memories I've had All of the things I did back then Wait, hol' up, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school? Jay 305 had gave me high five When I said Im in hot pursuit You said, ""I wont ride until Kendrick drive A new Monte Carlo that cruise"" And that shot my pride, I tried to improv But no freestyle I never do You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti You overlookin' every nigga that aint quite ready To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee Hol' up, that pussy petty Yeah, your nails did, your hair did Your cell phone is selfish It only got numbers that come with a Hummer Her new prima donna I smelt it Tried to make you mine, ho! Tried to make some time, ho! But I aint got the time or the patience To stop and wait in line, ho! Her dreams holds Versace She fall for Armani Only deal with rich niggasfuck you and Mick Romney!

Benson Boone,Before You,"106 ContributorsTranslationsEspaolDeutschTrkeCatalBefore You Go Lyrics I fell by the wayside like everyone else I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself Our every moment, I start to replace 'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say  When you hurt under the surface Like troubled water running cold Well, time can heal, but this won't  So before you go Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better? If only I'da known you had a storm to weather So before you go Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting? It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless So before you go  Was never the right time whenever you called Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all Our every moment, I start to replay But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face  When you hurt under the surface Like troubled water running cold Well, time can heal, but this won't  So before you go Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better? If only I'da known you had a storm to weather So before you go Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting? It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless So before you go  Would we be better off by now If I'da let my walls come down? Maybe, I guess we'll never know You know, you know  Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?

Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do Before school starts this fall (Come on, Perry!) So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!","[[0.001227931989708902, 0.0026076580842504167, 0.0012736032742411323, 0.005444592330640839, 0.0008918104357410949, 0.0017926154549155247, 0.008619399509094171, 0.005460151034696624, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0021411857122343517, 0.008971703514276645, 0.007370552798096712, 0.0007114921088968345, 0.0, 0.004586933274350861, 0.0015938866070124515, 0.0022141133658438593, 0.0066369539401392764, 0.005692288941402463, 0.0038937174649462006, 0.0017182079311810303, 0.009421237648325363, 0.0051154272079452535, 0.0, 0.006991424590899517, 0.005227308497030395, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008418819807777459, 0.0, 0.004184375369756192, 0.00361686044388072, 0.0, 0.004518731378235046, 0.0054800851163665084, 0.001785651547082849, 0.0, 0.0, 0.007825172134920436, 0.0, 0.003753708567480697, 0.0, 0.004098700300212925, 0.0014755694827735153, 0.002131876051900739, 0.0049269066139162425, 0.002864814218804574, 0.0, 0.009305404005531285, 0.0011034154300347233, 0.004953602210410928, 0.0, 0.0047493484937206005, 0.0, 0.0034596772232056232, 0.0, 0.004478999677243551, 0.002211492725836897, 0.0, 0.006056170171450885, 0.0020707631867851128, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0024154558316480577, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0027129041903688933, 0.0, 0.0, 0.001290884065245877]]"

In first glance, it seems like Vessel wanted it to stay with him because he liked it. Read More  Well, I've been waking up under blades, blue blossom days If only Damocles would hit me back No alabaster carvings or faces on a farthing Would prevent my head from fading to black  And it feels like falling into the sea From outer space in seconds to me And I play discordant days on repeat Until they look like harmony  When the river runs dry and the curtain is called How will I know if I can't see the bottom? Come up for air and choke on it all No one else knows that I've got a problem What if I can't get up and stand tall? What if the diamond days are all gone And who will I be when th empire falls? Wake up alon and I'll be forgotten  Well, I know I should be touring I know these chords are boring But I can't always be killing the game No golden grand pianos or voices from the shadows Will do anythin' but feel the same  And it feels like falling into the deep From somewhere way up over the peaks And I play discordant days on repeat Until the tape runs out on me  When the river runs dry and the curtain is called How will I know if I can't see the bottom? Come up for air and choke on it all No one else knows that I've got a problem What if I can't get up and stand tall? What if the diamond days are all gone And who will I be when the empire falls? Wake up alone and I'll be forgotten  And nobody told me I'd be begging for relief When what is silent to you feels like it's screaming to me Well, nobody told me I'd get tired of myself When it all looks like heaven, but it feels like hell When the river runs dry and the curtain is called How will I know if I can't see the bottom? Come up for air and choke on it all No one else knows that I've got a problem What if I can't get up and stand tall? What if the diamond days are all gone And who will I be when the empire falls?

That we've no idea what we've got Until we lose it (Until we lose it, until we lose it) And no amount of love will keep it around If we don't choose it (Choose it) And I don't know what's got its teeth in me But I'm about to bite back in anger No amount of self-sought fury Will bring back the glory of innocence  My, my, those eyes like fire I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre Come now, bite through these wires I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire  When we were made, I know It was no accident You know my desire We were tangled up like branches in a flood  I have traveled far beyond the path of reason Take me back to Eden Take me back to Eden","[[0.019461470908721943, 0.049146196680931176, 0.0003953997505157323, 0.0879695229229323, 0.0007098993843076281, 0.008004382999865273, 0.010095551135740758, 0.0013471495713136905, 0.0007711743324885567, 0.0038486985496527146, 0.0004445944706821512, 0.003929946140048269, 0.008900518112546418, 0.004027329283195924, 0.011875050533956396, 0.017000179345584943, 0.0044324118069087445, 0.002929158523202431, 0.004888586658574531, 0.002109081270032356, 0.001639956939008905, 0.0015077662370622292, 0.007800577755967211, 0.0, 0.01008151625898572, 0.007254170436852571, 0.0034045975810709146, 0.0005160475452034819, 0.0, 0.003622456389509202, 0.0006673543276883698, 0.008295391384698831, 0.02044224411295292, 0.001577683531331471, 0.006419048075117073, 0.0021652024370451012, 0.0011986825291964394, 0.0008882575777108474, 0.003941740260348388, 0.006425709026358385, 0.000666877432243067, 0.03626356993081548, 0.004191282269951586, 0.0, 0.005380437780349692, 0.009622823807531046, 0.014606516892544205, 0.0023385493126235244, 0.0024276364292102437, 0.011961942803093581, 0.008870266263485579, 0.007993823908644981, 0.0, 0.0008997969979788493, 0.002022978010585206, 0.011429291789664451, 0.01108704805260704, 0.0, 0.011822225459482147, 0.013238497121283957, 0.012984066605819992, 0.006786146830881017, 0.0030866382915224477, 0.021065280872021714, 0.0, 0.0, 0.013592918933493165, 0.004235751232430629, 0.00029198644942863005, 0.02049551801351426, 0.005719332395958852, 0.02586779731831197, 0.002021059315036064, 0.0, 0.006011031999762433]]"

What does it mean for your mask to Read More  Count me out like sovereigns, payback for the good times Right foot in the roses, left foot on a landmine I'm not gonna be there tripping on the grapevine They can sing the words while I cry into the bassline Wear me out like Prada, devil in my detail I swear it's getting harder even just to exhale Backed up into corners, bitter in the lens I'm sick of tryna hide it every time thy take mine  So stick to me Stick to m like caramel Walk beside me till you feel nothin' as well  They ask me, ""Is it goin' good in the garden?"" Say, ""I'm lost, but I beg no pardon"" Up on the dice, but low on the cards I try not to talk about how it's harder now Can I get a mirror side-stage? Looking sideways at my own visage, gettin' worse Every time they try to shout my real name just to get a rise from me Acting like I'm never stressed out by the hearsay I guess that's what I get for tryna hide in the limelight Guess that's what I get for having 2020 hindsight Everybody wants eyes on 'em, I just wanna hear you sing that top line  And if you don't think I mean it, then I understand But I'm still glad you came, so let me see those hands  So stick to me Stick to me like caramel Walk beside me till you feel nothin' as well I'm fallin' free of the final parallel The sweetest dreams are bitter But there's no one left to tell  Too young to get bitter over it all Too old to retaliate like before Too blessed to be caught ungrateful, I know So I'll keep dancin' along to the rhythm This stage is a prison (Too young to get bitter over it all), a beautiful nightmare A war of attrition (Too old to retaliate like before), I'll take what I'm given The deepest incisions (Too blessed to be caught ungrateful, I know), I thought I got better But maybe I didn't  (In these days of days) Tell me, did I give you what you came for? (I wish it all away) Terrified to answer my own front door (I thought things had changed) Missin' my wings in a realm of angels (But everything's the same)  So I'll keep dancin' along to the rhythm This stage is a prison, a beautiful nightmare A war of attrition, I'll take what I'm given The deepest incisions, I thought I got better But maybe I didn't","[[0.0, 0.015765423284555147, 0.002800706056141226, 0.009298207001905324, 0.002046372204402305, 0.0034654465926001743, 0.008318534478673477, 0.0031450861239028655, 0.0018227355639604769, 0.003317738889611206, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0063653233143251275, 0.005535072100083547, 0.0, 0.0, 0.010125021660047157, 0.007839756257561472, 0.005465246176461296, 0.0018868326488077514, 0.014723906387136434, 0.00337469119253828, 0.009102938039256868, 0.00831838221451055, 0.0033407326898378547, 0.0, 0.005876080622034507, 0.003506900762022167, 0.005704293161403376, 0.003829620907410672, 0.0020531229476877006, 0.002486163996937476, 0.014013865483889703, 0.0, 0.011842213816477482, 0.004132568634712038, 0.00207479996911389, 0.01146805405096157, 0.0, 0.006004349915794227, 0.004225506850532365, 0.012750179169564608, 0.0045378010309788715, 0.0, 0.029785475680474034, 0.010376172157396144, 0.0, 0.006475310630061487, 0.0017670653645083367, 0.0028385358966557073, 0.0033543344070959317, 0.01531429609346512, 0.0, 0.0037025252359705074, 0.009972223404850331, 0.01267762908089429, 0.0, 0.005282870587516468, 0.026893216523082235, 0.0031773351444580474, 0.002372864623060935, 0.004589683006258487, 0.0, 0.002520233172155654, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0066968753089374985, 0.0014078110895729893, 0.0028073046401082312, 0.012133131674211622, 0.014993810140998565, 0.0017670589538297324, 0.0028923406846822837, 0.014788379850211562]]"

And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive (Ooh-ooh) When they never see good in me Even though I got hood in me Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord  It seems that all the autumn leaves are fallin' Ooh-ooh-ooh I feel like you're the only reason for it Ooh All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do Ooh-ooh-ooh All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do Ooh  Ooh-ooh Ooh","[[0.0, 0.008138236541428782, 0.0028464569944309445, 0.005356406336972646, 0.0005935369711326859, 0.004145397948171827, 0.0024031493518478796, 0.0010946797007431253, 0.0, 0.0014048813358014276, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0015372508180200462, 0.004528546768915002, 0.0, 0.0011223454241665028, 0.0010861119421088732, 0.002104019885799313, 0.001085532496834701, 0.0002598366599908134, 0.023522814515777857, 0.0012207312469333792, 0.0019040139092031518, 0.0005192451658293492, 0.011154251216112248, 0.0, 0.0007705645542708038, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0012410295157348412, 0.002938034660530938, 0.014578141621730852, 0.005355348737004484, 0.0, 0.005566643393442576, 0.00028204766921835966, 0.0013843038812636837, 0.00023431461142008528, 0.0013432580641149269, 0.0015443372868526142, 0.0, 0.002044225190926602, 0.01558925954365467, 0.0, 0.005107680022188504, 0.011771483833440871, 0.0, 0.0005834445994758812, 0.0, 0.0008225466624700849, 0.003358788866682708, 0.01295230624689338, 0.0, 0.0024199065113514745, 0.0022645062073296386, 0.006444814617000583, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02421906160894509, 0.0019292759679173093, 0.010546756290638707, 0.004660321578376003, 0.000575655606642023, 0.001686268457877221, 0.0041040107291650885, 0.0, 0.0, 0.009637593648545106, 0.0012609929690345092, 0.0027678009672237047, 0.000609527391632774, 0.005170230080306492, 0.001895668336704715, 0.00406093137176754, 0.002080455000819908]]"

J. Cole,Crooked Smile,"219 ContributorsCrooked Smile Lyrics Even though I On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how My shit is crookedlook at how far I done got without it! I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell Love yourself, girl, or nobody will Though you a woman I don't know how you deal With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you You wake up, put makeup on Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!"" What it's like to have a crooked smile  Even though I On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile) You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)  To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure And when I tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure 'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin' So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin' Take it from a man that loves what you got And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care 'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be And that's you, never let 'em see your frown And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud I can tell you ain't laughed in a while But I wanna see that crooked smile  Even though I On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round  We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em Look at the nation That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele? But one more time for the 'Ville And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil' Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail I got money for the bail now, and well now If you askin' will I tell nowayy, hell nah I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now How you like this crooked smile?  Even though I On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile) You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round  We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round   La la la, la la la, la-lalala La la la, la la la, la-lalala La la la, la la la, la-lalala La la la, la la la, la-lalala On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round Back round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round Back round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round Round","[[0.012125719745162222, 0.02840465026751732, 0.0001805003724979182, 0.01274288906751667, 0.01734910710756887, 0.0021940270547470063, 0.010444721167640187, 0.0005352348201122758, 0.0008840248578530234, 0.00023868351154094597, 0.0012598739750876882, 0.002138643345575656, 0.0037450427082950377, 0.006298555414018933, 0.0, 0.011820218869243773, 0.0014658879277002002, 0.0019008674155706164, 0.01574168015624929, 0.000739094300364932, 0.005912712712908235, 0.00094330828565503, 0.0026805917707570168, 0.005859614592949216, 0.0, 0.0002741711503120537, 0.0015812978873933142, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.002185588630859149, 0.005038275246649941, 0.01726207566959232, 0.0, 0.0069760650968761564, 0.03524651843175195, 0.004926047870887104, 0.0028171101878555066, 0.0, 0.010839633546238863, 0.0013281898013606777, 0.009644010037261752, 0.001802356922467466, 0.0, 0.00020914535305228965, 0.006344179902705009, 0.0015959387606374609, 0.0022927540866731484, 0.001039475857929285, 0.015740822125238633, 0.009205409593138276, 0.009143121571211141, 0.002847868945567235, 0.005569521332802184, 0.0014174942439689313, 0.020325049366886557, 0.002983287027229505, 0.0, 0.046206461308956503, 0.008688201309277836, 0.0, 0.0025784165810945267, 0.0, 0.008190942875244642, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0033677885968267465, 0.0011841939486849854, 0.004283044123842697, 0.0, 0.011024233118222353, 0.005804038751632844, 0.004645542229354328, 0.014929963259141171]]"

And let the good times roll Let smoke rings from this paper, doll Blow sweet and thick till every thought of it don't mean a thing  I got some colour back, she thinks so too I laugh like me again, she laughs like you  I wouldn't know where to start Sweet music playing in the dark Be still, my foolish heart Don't ruin this on me I wouldn't know where to start Sweet music playing in the dark Be still, my foolish heart Don't ruin this on me  I wouldn't know where I wouldn't know where I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where I wouldn't, mmm I wouldn't know where I wouldn't know where I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where I wouldn't know  The very thought of you and am I blue? A love supreme seems far removed I get along without you very well some other nights Oh, the radio news reader chimes Reporting Russian lullabies She'll turn to me awake and ask, ""Is everything alright?""

That I'd walk so far just to take The injury of finally knowin' you?  It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la) It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la) You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la) Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown And there are some people, love, who are better unknown","[[0.04603731929534691, 0.06132412727725813, 0.01526159545698439, 0.008022015648283027, 0.002875614267485841, 0.0, 0.0014439446192177742, 0.002056496941641096, 0.002901274940133648, 0.0016613991700911305, 0.0014124080924628026, 0.006225913117878019, 0.0033582689874196675, 0.0059047571448245925, 0.0, 0.039460354124918225, 0.005213989894390414, 0.0069614221857085224, 0.0018232537614179976, 0.0051982671419809326, 0.007227499050959572, 0.0, 0.014031855265774773, 0.0, 0.002009012257002102, 0.0019069490491631545, 0.0066610181309979455, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.013396386059054632, 0.0036162785049642016, 0.00920393154729196, 0.0, 0.01783853485168598, 0.00435021722584165, 0.004845729339909872, 0.00791695973484678, 0.002304416022012465, 0.0012585340512427307, 0.006127384342600871, 0.007848561067209497, 0.0, 0.0, 0.012254185304478584, 0.007835699542118784, 0.0, 0.002322209161669095, 0.0016334732492188223, 0.009753404625579713, 0.01325387353155561, 0.006272888215478362, 0.011425561559017585, 0.0023810943281151273, 0.0004164563892390888, 0.01244446297767935, 0.00836898013666638, 0.0, 0.002459811304532265, 0.031050027711399888, 0.007045474566121667, 0.008847709371126984, 0.0, 0.0032515471117849533, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008227612646765399, 0.0006502176078335548, 0.05098938527724802, 0.0, 0.004597238697841844, 0.0008406195531181093, 0.0, 0.004091521068073692]]"

They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about The existence of you  For a moment, I was heavenstruck  Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym) Everything comes out teenage petulance ""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him) ""I might just die, it would make no difference"" Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood) Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up Fuck it if I can't have us I might just not get up, I might stay  Down bad (Like I lost my twin) Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad) Down bad (Wavin' at the ship) Fuck it if I can't have him  I loved your hostile takeovers Encounters closer and closer All your indecent exposures How dare you say that it's I'll build you a fort on some planet Where they can all understand it How dare you think it's romantic Leaving me safe and stranded 'Cause fuck it, I was in love So fuck you if I can't have us 'Cause fuck it, I was in love  Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym) Everything comes out teenage petulance ""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him) ""I might just die, it would make no difference"" Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood) Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up Fuck it if I can't have us I might just not get up, I might stay  Down bad (Like I lost my twin) Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad) Down bad (Wavin' at the ship) Fuck it if I can't have him  Like I lost my twin Fuck it if I can't have him Down bad (Wavin' at the ship) Fuck it if I can't have him","[[0.024085580669088207, 0.0284894358468095, 0.0025006515844188284, 0.0035994904095328073, 0.0021339097611804037, 0.0, 0.011742869650055202, 0.0, 0.003945290031584927, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003510115565420554, 0.014908984336379013, 0.00732948849503606, 0.002017775772438678, 0.017992692022452336, 0.0, 0.003315399619283134, 0.0017432807555397497, 0.0, 0.003718924953158476, 0.0, 0.003104472189124042, 0.0, 0.00241539601245087, 0.010030577206676846, 0.0, 0.0055554849687505, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0039286370955507865, 0.0, 0.006641601619758818, 0.0, 0.0023848594300469985, 0.0009944255812372523, 0.0, 0.01604541118039754, 0.0, 0.0010046912974583826, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005361763697799587, 0.0, 0.001039699935821613, 0.0012764767030139566, 0.004275619868756084, 0.004056204177184442, 0.04118819356677438, 0.0, 0.0018167831456992686, 0.0005330366257672612, 0.004899039303561954, 0.0, 0.0, 0.016303778407958477, 0.01747195399549845, 0.004163348904411925, 0.001159402801555369, 0.0, 0.005671717912713296, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.002955603814555263, 0.0, 0.0020307134374307886, 0.0, 0.002332617144753721, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005905240907568041]]"

Lifts me up when I'm down and out Still look to him without a doubt Still got a best friend, best friend Shout it out Like there's never been a louder mouth Should have never been allowed a mouth Now that I got a higher power, now When I blackout, power outageoww They powerless, but they crowd around They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep But I'll be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard When I'm counted out You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce But pronounce you dead when they sound it out So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now He's all around you pow! Not even the doctors at the hospital Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life It's im-piggy-possible to revive you That's word to the Diggy Doc Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option Somethin' I'm not gonna do I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit Talkin' to Proof, droppin' a deuce Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot And who you think's my Glock that I use That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters?

Zach Bryan,28,"22 ContributorsTranslationsEspaol28 Lyrics You took a train to the south side of Boston You showed me where your old man stayed Took twenty-eight years of blood I was lost in To feel loved on my own birthday And I always felt like I's in between somethin' Like home and somewhere far away But tonight on the west side in a bar out in Brooklyn I saw tears outline your face  How lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week, but you're all grown now There's smoke seepin' out of your bloody teeth But you're home somehow  And I'll be upstairs with the guitar I's given When I was barely fourteen When did McGlinchy's get so crowded And why are th crowds so damn green? I lost my mind on the streets of the city And maybe I lost all hope too Took twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me To get to this evening with you  How lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week, but we're all grown now There's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street But we're home somehow  How lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week and we're all grown now There's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street But we're home somehow  You took a train to the south side of Boston You showed me where your whole heart stayed Took twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me To feel loved on my own birthday","[[0.0, 0.006273524783531563, 0.0, 0.004583648044765862, 0.0, 0.005863040740128754, 0.008270298179231684, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.011923612263965835, 0.0, 0.0, 0.002996096569266691, 0.007978889325083498, 0.004009652858044987, 0.0, 0.0019097143801429452, 0.0, 0.013993302028919533, 0.0, 0.03513794534876633, 0.0, 0.024013249455809994, 0.0018168572263325869, 0.006929848614639936, 0.0, 0.023772441324215254, 0.004168380365819743, 0.0058539181985869685, 0.0, 0.0025908522561276645, 0.0029095409220739493, 0.0, 0.005368933821802077, 0.004018374850625046, 0.0013715634411258061, 0.0, 0.001618816720431965, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.009140697335209412, 0.0, 0.0019157498054553474, 0.0, 0.006238257277160432, 0.017160795475147053, 0.0023058225739319834, 0.0025680517461974276, 0.0025284397304533345, 0.0, 0.0, 0.011648181343757263, 0.0, 0.010202843928587798, 0.01248639489036863, 0.0, 0.0074493332789450336, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0013380107004952798, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0040495844955874775, 0.003167375082081722, 0.003374945265318505, 0.00926678221522434]]"

Terrapin Station was released as the B-side to the albums Read More  Let my inspiration flow In token rhyme suggesting rhythm That will not forsake me 'Til my tale is told and done While the firelight's aglow Strange shadows from the flames will grow 'Til things we've never seen Will seem familiar Shadows of a sailor forming Winds both foul and fair all swarm Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady Many years ago Here beside him stands a man A soldier from the looks of him Who came through many fights But lost at love While the storyteller speaks A door within the fire creaks Suddenly flies open And a girl is standing there  Eyes alight with glowing hair All that fancy paints as fair She takes her fan and throws it In the lion's den ""Which of you to gain me, tell Will risk uncertain pains of hell? I will not forgive you If you will not take the chance"" The sailor gave at least a try The soldier being much too wise Strategy was his strength And not disaster The sailor coming out again The lady fairly leapt at him That's how it stands today You decide if he was wise The storyteller makes no choice Soon you will not hear his voice His job is to shed light And not to master Since the end is never told We pay the teller off in gold In hopes he will come back But he cannot be bought or sold   Inspiration move me brightly Light the song with sense and color Hold away despair More than this I will not ask Faced with mysteries dark and vast Statements just seem vain at last Some rise, some fall, some climb To get to Terrapin Counting stars by candlelight All are dim but one is bright: The spiral light of Venus Rising first and shining best Oh, from the northwest corner Of a brand-new crescent moon Crickets and cicadas sing A rare and different tune Terrapin Station In the shadow of the moon Terrapin Station And I know we'll be there soon Terrapin, I can't figure out Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning Terrapin, but the train's put its brakes on And the whistle is screaming Terrapin   While you were gone These faces filled with darkness The obvious was hidden With nothing to believe in The compass always points to Terrapin Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again For good or ill again","[[0.012156898273450274, 0.024139903549582464, 0.007164339319280888, 0.007151946137365631, 0.003564531433525015, 0.0, 0.008175473156673831, 0.002735790998661085, 0.0007827316612573565, 0.0, 0.011057133122814736, 0.0017781253887849046, 0.0077969975823899895, 0.007139291159622426, 0.0035224283717567363, 0.011212478893866146, 0.0, 0.007974414370025528, 0.005952122785761807, 0.0006189054812048733, 0.005070667757256663, 0.01370236143845944, 0.005952928877764559, 0.0021902621154714073, 0.015880521713006805, 0.0069035223632279916, 0.0, 0.0, 0.004666769727616044, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0024755405591669376, 0.007762101137039114, 0.0, 0.007164191154620182, 0.00234757686937424, 0.0031727553888814077, 0.0038584871921908486, 0.006046461036829927, 0.003457309853922367, 0.0, 0.00396830786743482, 0.002456318950487386, 0.002544790698564228, 0.028842721729409767, 0.009097718899065138, 0.0, 0.0022647880035487704, 0.0006953548090244117, 0.0029472693877077827, 0.008092733409685705, 0.008833736363174525, 0.0, 0.002536027000482046, 0.003176775875600798, 0.005332612024399226, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003914159628768919, 0.01166534009369283, 0.010880230923769224, 0.006776188406498969, 0.005337217851391047, 0.004202983819204872, 0.001895109634283125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005239281724690049, 0.0, 0.002624615739571593, 0.0, 0.003084162404564585, 0.007290436414060581, 0.0, 0.004318315858030174]]"

Would you hold it near as it were your own?  It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken Perhaps they're better left unsung I don't know, don't really care Let there be songs to fill the air  Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow  Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty If your cup is full, may it be again Let it be known there is a fountain That was not made by the hands of men  There is a road, no simple highway Between the dawn and the dark of night And if you go, no one may follow That path is for your steps alone  Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow  You who choose to lead must follow But if you fall you fall alone If you should stand then who's to guide you? If I knew the way I would take you home","[[0.004972659990825867, 0.0030843260899860235, 0.0014462269803245558, 0.002635212060959881, 0.00382398724482867, 0.0008391899351027596, 0.00450038788670505, 0.0051443783611818325, 0.007471419012595904, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0017281005930548708, 0.004322409826364865, 0.00036390541896080147, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0008820609997239239, 0.001357701420852725, 0.00903721202978288, 0.0004126303109000002, 0.005549592297954489, 0.0011626922790187349, 0.012426854982635403, 0.005160130548305683, 0.0, 0.002868855793524454, 0.0015581035245471307, 0.0007066241529001677, 0.0, 0.0, 0.00787525620577887, 0.0, 0.002514975889354678, 0.0, 0.0, 0.010053273722085034, 0.0, 0.001816878729837047, 0.0, 0.0046581104420750676, 0.0, 0.004626669072934203, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0030088301266685442, 0.008995430270853864, 0.0, 0.0029916374248447884, 0.0, 0.003911410009948766, 0.0, 0.008447078091861066, 0.012232444425103925, 0.0014323928160499865, 0.0023102536335551636, 0.005695284918242484, 0.005881557733371679, 0.0, 0.008139398419467857, 0.000646153187768327, 0.0073635480551739, 0.00972789775710752, 0.0, 0.0004733985709131495, 0.003011009269528733, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003825692883574691, 0.0024305015678804235, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.003898662290847225, 0.0, 0.006910747893117898]]"

For this is all a dream we dreamed One afternoon, long ago  Walk out of any doorway Feel your way, feel your way like the day before Maybe you'll find direction Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you  What do you want me to do To watch for you while you are sleeping? Then please don't be surprised When you find me dreaming, too   Look into any eyes you find by you You can see clear through to another day Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes On other days while going home  What do you want me to do To do for you, to see you through? It's all a dream we dreamed One afternoon, long ago  Walk into splintered sunlight Inch your way through dead dreams to another land Maybe you're tired and broken Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear  What do you want me to do To do for you, to see you through? A box of rain will ease the pain And love will see you through  Just a box of rain, wind, and water Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on Sun and shower, wind and rain In and out the window like a moth before a flame  And it's just a box of rain I don't know who put it there Believe it if you need it Or leave it if you dare And it's just a box of rain Or a ribbon for your hair Such a long long time to be gone And a short time to be there","[[0.006509889800356456, 0.014930263335682032, 0.0025693854526666576, 0.011130044284633359, 0.010952088100946576, 0.006079446413610568, 0.004215602197746931, 0.005396025761235393, 0.0038022934266262244, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0009535064574575074, 0.00390930921480739, 0.013459769193231262, 0.0, 0.006003321908054318, 0.006585237119036673, 0.005136666689429425, 0.002939263331721495, 0.004944544626525153, 0.010002982661768465, 0.0, 0.022135388682304247, 0.014912705926134716, 0.0, 0.0, 0.018632982293886335, 0.0, 0.0, 0.023669881820012815, 0.010228307724084977, 0.007847110843791085, 0.00510482299819725, 0.0, 0.002039745756569986, 0.009584872052037391, 0.002717218983714484, 0.007942851880465842, 0.0, 0.0035080758451235677, 0.0, 0.09062341789036331, 0.0, 0.008094955273547753, 0.0016666504013057193, 0.001970959315999665, 0.0, 0.007521044422682651, 0.0, 0.013561932143421739, 0.0017031947578028627, 0.007076838557902201, 0.007631620836179835, 0.005636452807491789, 0.0061303042545298855, 0.005985813511478747, 0.015591971561623152, 0.0, 0.009999884062497225, 0.005537175637997314, 0.003134600729245377, 0.0013111994523984233, 0.0015870315430091448, 0.0020788360601358353, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.007383729520681573, 0.0008397019807933124, 0.005513821849886726, 0.0, 0.0031896747879452798, 0.005199792567547473, 0.01455372879612078, 0.009781441541338564]]"

Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that 'Cause...  I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love  Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the seventies on your own My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is ""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"" You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it 'Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy, was she wrong That was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you What are you, what are you so afraid of?

Cody Johnson,Dirt Cheap,"17 ContributorsDirt Cheap Lyrics They came in thinkin' top dollar To that old cotton crop farmer They knocked on his screen door and he said ""Lord, what you need, boys?"" And they said ""You know all the others went and cashed out We got the subdivision all mapped out It'll sit right here on this land And you could leave town a rich man"" And he said, ""Boys, whatever you're offerin', it won't be enough  'Cause I got a little girl that used to swing right there I still see her pink bow in her brown hair She's in the big city, but she still calls home What's she gonna do if she comes back and we're gone? And ovr there, under that whit oak tree Beneath the cross is where my best buddy's buried Lasted thirteen huntin' seasons runnin' strong Keep your money 'cause a man can't leave his dog And over there is where I got down on one knee You can't buy that kind of dirt cheap""  One man smiled and he kinda looked away The other said, ""Before we go, I gotta know one thing Between the droughts and the floods through all the years What in the world got you through? How the hell'd you get here?"" And he said  ""That little girl that used to swing right there I still see her pink bow in her brown hair Runnin' up after one of them long days A big smile makin' every little worry fade And over there, under that white oak tree Beneath the cross, where my best buddy's buried All them huntin' seasons freezin' in a jon boat Me and him, double-barrel and a two-stroke And that woman that said 'yes' when I got down on one knee Yeah, you can't buy that kind of dirt cheap  No, it ain't somethin' you fall into It's somethin' God gives you And you hold on to  Just like that little girl who used to swing right there I still see her pink bow in her brown hair She's in the big city now, but she still calls home She's comin' back next week and, man, it's been too long And over there, under that white oak tree Beside the cross, where my best buddy's buried Lays a puppy posted up in the shade That woman never could turn away a stray I guess that's why she said 'yes' when I got down on one knee Oh, long as all this is here, why the hell would I ever leave?

I don't remember Life before she came into the picture Brought the beauty I was missin' with her Showed me colors I ain't ever seen She took chances With every wall I built, she saw a canvas I thank God every day for how He made her My life was black and white, but she's the painter  I don't remember Life before she came into the picture Brought the beauty I was missin' with her Showed me colors I ain't ever seen She took chances With every wall I built, she saw a canvas I thank God every day for how He made her My life was black and white, but she's the painter  She's the painter","[[0.014051826963816549, 0.0053332356639693625, 0.007017905066616267, 0.008051755612019889, 0.00413613403031075, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0076224498613145005, 0.009434111307797885, 0.0, 0.015105839555059855, 0.0, 0.0, 0.008673157381394734, 0.0, 0.0, 0.010330659974564126, 0.025504651264007562, 0.01743071523288918, 0.012975978996721774, 0.005336879265528973, 0.0, 0.034780173315660315, 0.0, 0.026979794722428094, 0.0, 0.021248860902616358, 0.0, 0.046224121825355305, 0.030460476180269834, 0.027692048910071976, 0.013692730579481296, 0.008589688005578775, 0.0, 0.009259568971553663, 0.009075052474510854, 0.010149270330201424, 0.009380770997585414, 0.0, 0.0490791963385407, 0.0, 0.05059199149256043, 0.00713419344340726, 0.0, 0.0030193083603454957, 0.0026068284311399027, 0.0, 0.0030635133287990586, 0.0, 0.017239668541745547, 0.0022612966019488635, 0.018408484742817026, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0023640942424235636, 0.010238145630085788, 0.009156246551627785, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0069278571696016035, 0.02187969309746328, 0.01891773427593993, 0.0, 0.004327118996278523, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01291379506150668, 0.004868676251396262, 0.005987768220558493, 0.0, 0.017028716146671327, 0.007329300628754098, 0.013078500566014633, 0.0013601531501587925]]"

Gracie Abrams,Free Now,"59 ContributorsTranslationsEspaolSloveninaItalianoPolskiPortugusFranaisTrkeFree Now Lyrics This isn't what you want, it's only how you feel You openly admit you're far away from healing And I hate to pull the plug, but I think I get your deal I finally know better than to wait for you back here And I hope you know I don't think You're a bad guy, that you're damaged Took you two months, only two to raise the bar You're the saddest, but a good kid Almost loved you, but I didn't I could laugh now, how we tried to play those parts  I know that you're removed, I can feel it when we talk You start to let me in, but then you shut it off And it's half of you that hurts sometimes, the half that I don't get I swear that I'm not mad at you, but I can't share your bed now And I can imagine, when you go home Does she follow like an echo? Like your shadow, you can try, but you can't run From the truth of what you both made That she blew up on a Tuesday How does pain taste when it melts into your tongue? It's a pain that I caught you at a bad time It's a shame that I memorized your outline You were straight up with me, you were so kind But I knew what you knew, honey, great minds It was harsh 'cause I lost what I wanted I was brave when I kissed you in London We're collateral here, man, we got hit Hope you find somewhere safe for your baggage Every page that I wrote, you were on it Feel you deep in my bones, you're the current And I showed no restraint, it was something I was scared of 'til you made me love it  If you find yourself out, if there is a right time Chances are I'll be here, we could share a lifeline If you feel like fallin', catch me on the way down Never been less empty, all I feel is free now If you find yourself out, if there is a right time Chances are I'll be here, we could share a lifeline If you feel like fallin', catch me on the way down Never been less empty, all I feel is free now","[[0.011348589911627046, 0.04772901078495432, 0.008845850798917929, 0.01531554587082308, 0.004620921340017257, 0.02325079504689596, 0.006763164977251807, 0.004674282005478457, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0016598983881309709, 0.0041573839551973645, 0.027771656029829225, 0.012503838738799171, 0.010466964681044966, 0.0014157348945760546, 0.0028655749737276867, 0.014019004375280641, 0.00919781458216678, 0.023006549498136644, 0.0060529319144327605, 0.014474368752980237, 0.02688540097286736, 0.041225171021975725, 0.0, 0.004835012034927512, 0.0, 0.008225480516328607, 0.0, 0.009552636832202368, 0.0026648743304471243, 0.023406046195598457, 0.0, 0.014857031631632768, 0.00913750018598767, 0.008395289565121566, 0.005976677100940647, 0.002569211100705856, 0.016840968627946904, 0.0, 0.0020035114120166074, 0.0, 0.0, 0.004955599960904837, 0.008465595429780844, 0.0, 0.0027687590383479593, 0.001927059691892918, 0.00751954456102485, 0.007322203070733359, 0.020599141104149617, 0.0047520145564222595, 0.0023674073588440202, 0.015648839119233607, 0.016578478835060858, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005433315245660962, 0.015739858396589573, 0.0253306935030273, 0.01202310495228171, 0.009540607093647211, 0.007501364803087344, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0033856585119547565, 0.0, 0.008448595473352711, 0.0, 0.010816835139370302, 0.00729402162170856, 0.03460588690791566, 0.010213390152957857]]"

Are your conversations cool? Like, are you even interested? I know what you ar, brighter than the stars Tell m if she takes you far Far enough away from all the baggage you've been carrying Up another hill to all the girls who'll help you bury it They're just blowing smoke I'll say what they won't I know everything they don't  I hear your voice like a boom in my tower I sleep alone, I'm completely fine (Mm) And you look stupid going out If she's got a pulse, she meets your standards now You feel nothing, and yet you still let her But I bet you're at her place right now You couldn't point her out in any crowd  Tell me, is she prettier than she was on the internet? Are your conversations cool? Like, are you even interested?

And her daddy has told her to go But her friend is nowhere to be seen Now she walks through her sunken dream To the seat with the clearest view And she's hooked to the silver screen  But the film is a saddening bore For she's lived it ten times or more She could spit in the eyes of fools As they ask her to focus on  Sailors fighting in the dance hall Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the lawman, beating up the wrong guy Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know He's in the best-selling show Is there life on Mars?  It's on America's tortured brow That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow Now the workers have struck for fame 'Cause Lennon's on sale again See the mice in their million hordes From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads Rule Britannia is out of bounds To my mother, my dog, and clowns  But the film is a saddening bore Because I wrote it ten times or more It's about to be writ again As I ask you to focus on Sailors fighting in the dance hall Oh, man! look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the lawman, beating up the wrong guy Oh, man!

Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines? Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up And when niggas holla, ""What's up?"" you give a dry response? Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it? Why you always buy me something when you going shopping? Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me?

Do you even have somewhere to go? Oh, could you tell me?

Nate Smith,World on Fire,"15 ContributorsWorld On Fire Lyrics Oh-oh  Liar, liar, the world's on fire What you gonna do when it all burns down? Fire, fire, burnin' higher Still got time to turn it all around  Now, I ain't one for speakin' out much But that don't mean I don't stay in touch Everybody's trippin' over this or that What we gonna do when we all fall flat?  Liar, liar, the world's on fire What we gonna do when it all burns down?  I don't know what to think about us When did we lose ""In God we trust?"" God almighty, what we gonna do? If God ain't listenin' and we're deaf too  Liar, liar, the world's on fire What you gonna do when it all burns down? Fire, fire, burnin' higher Still got time to turn it all around  Don't get me started on politics Now how are we to live in a world like this? Greedy politicians, present and past They wouldn't know the truth if it bit 'em in the ass  (What you gonna do?) Now tell me, what is truth? (What you gonna do?) Have we all lost sight (What you gonna do?) Of common decency? (What you gonna do?) Of wrong and right? How do we heal this great divide? Do we care enough to try? But liar, liar, the world's on fire What we gonna do when it all burns down?  Billy got a gun, Joey got a knife Janie got a sign to carry in the fight Marchin' in the streets with sticks and stones Don't you ever believe words don't break bones  Oh, can't we rise above? Can't we show some love? Do we just give up or make a change? We know all too well We've all been through hell Time to break the spell in Heaven's name  Liar, liar, the world's on fire What you gonna do when it all burns down? Fire, fire, burnin' higher (Fire, fire) Still got time to turn it all around Liar, liar, the world's on fire What you gonna do when it all burns down?

(Liar, liar, the world's on fire) (What you gonna do when it all burns down?) Show some love (Fire, fire, the world's on fire) (Still got time to turn it all around) Let's rise above (Liar, liar, the world's on fire) (What you gonna do when it all burns down?) Let's make a stand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire) (What you gonna do when it all burns down?) Let's lend a hand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire) (Still got time to turn it all around) Let's heal the hurt (Liar, liar, the world's on fire) (What you gonna do when it all burns down?)

Ethel, having run away from home, meets charming  Isaiah, who offers her a ride. Together, they drive from Texas to California. Over the course of their trip Read More  You fell in love with America when you were twelve years old And by seventeen, you knew you had to see it all You loved your dad and the love he had for your mother, so You had to get out and go chasin' its sweet call  I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfare On the side of the road in some torn-up clothes with a pistol in my pocket I didn't trust no one, but you said, ""Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere"" So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking  And you said, ""Hey, do you wanna see th west with me? 'Cause lov's out there and I can't leave it be"" And I said, ""Honey, love's never meant much to me But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need""  So we made off for California To find your lover, drivin' day and night And every small town diner Saw our faces at least once or twice But in these motel rooms I started to see you differently, oh 'Cause for the first time since I was a child I could see a man who wasn't angry  And he said, ""It's been a long damn time since I left Florida No one left to leave and no one left to love But now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'"" And we found heaven in time where your western sunshine Met my deep southern wet And you got lost in it and yet you found yourself Hard-pressed for air and sweatin'  And you said, ""Hey, do you wanna see the west with me? (Do you wanna see the west with me?) 'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"" (I can't leave it, I can't leave it) And I said, ""Honey, love's never meant that much to me (Nothing much) But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need""  And once we reached the coast, you said, ""End of the line We finally reached the edge after all this time I didn't find my love, but I still made it this far without it"" And then you turned to me and stared into me deep And said, ""Well, maybe not 'cause look at what I've got You might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it""  And you said, ""Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?

Shaboozey,Last of My Kind,"18 ContributorsLast of My Kind LyricsLast of My Kind exposes the anxiety surrounding social change. Isbell reaches into his own psyche as a native of rural Alabama now living in bigger cities to identify with people for whom these changes feel Read More  Couldn't be happy in the city at night You can't see the stars from the neon light Sidewalk's dirty and the river's worse Underground trains all run in reverse Nobody here can dance like me Everybody clapping on the one and the three Am I the last of my kind? Am I the last of my kind?  So many people with so much to do The winter's so cold, my hands turn blue Old men sleeping on the filthy ground They spend their whole day just walking around Nobody else here seems to care They walk right past them like they ain't even there Am I the last of my kind? Am I the last of my kind?  Daddy said the river would always lead me home But the river can't take me back in time and Daddy's dead and gone And the family farm's a parking lot for Walton's five-and-dime Am I the last of my kind? Am I the last of my kind?  I tried to go to college, but I didn't belong Everything I said was either funny or wrong They laughed at my boots, laughed at my jeans Laughed when they gave me amphetamines Left me alone in a bad part of town Thirty-six hours to come back down Am I the last of my kind? Am I the last of my kind?

Am I lost inside my mind? There's an emerald in the sky I hear the river say your name By the stars above, I know we were in love I hear the river say your name I have only 'til the night is over","[[0.041476670553034625, 0.05795111348560864, 0.0011483413342985712, 0.004475495407428752, 0.004705503301231965, 0.0021090485448932218, 0.004114167451525328, 0.000768434679066431, 0.002647143864135545, 0.0020626075608620115, 0.0, 0.006003995526467338, 0.002859945451819338, 0.014418428185541269, 0.0, 0.0381842172878256, 0.001016334750940576, 0.0053879386148252915, 0.0024544162761093646, 0.0, 0.005550255080771996, 0.0020711042625076444, 0.006594059789713025, 0.002765870081524208, 0.00873342953615746, 0.0, 0.0027473751734184092, 0.004065165380178479, 0.0, 0.0, 0.061346952545820455, 0.011131011344038936, 0.0008638645465660011, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0031878177276441987, 0.002881662546450613, 0.003754409949987647, 0.010020099825322145, 0.0011321904347362747, 0.004701406188692121, 0.013718161410104245, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005267713244810799, 0.0, 0.0042021915560430945, 0.0, 0.0038417320571100325, 0.005808468064100984, 0.0028375982693391844, 0.0, 0.0, 0.001266326664408159, 0.0054627155876646434, 0.010819424585276174, 0.01723029021775748, 0.0, 0.02994994003519359, 0.005546799397747667, 0.007908163805608874, 0.0017605184145849675, 0.0021155606311198056, 0.013525369926562919, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0016671679048922427, 0.0, 0.0008075492898699003, 0.0038837356942145198, 0.00916475135703487, 0.0007078948770927807]]"

What you're looking for won't be found easily It grows upon the mountain in a sacred place Up beyond the clouds, in ancient ground, so they say And many men have died trekking up that way  Once he's gazed upon her, a man is forever changed The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain Ages come and go, but her life goes on the same She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain  Her colors change to mark the passing of the days No earthly sight can match the beauty she displays And when I die, I want her lying by my side In my grave, in my grave, oh  I'd give it all to love that girl I'll be the one to pluck that fleur  I'm meant to find the place where all good things begin To smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind And when I die, I want her lying by my side In my grave, in my grave   I'd give it all to love that girl I'll be the one to pluck that fleur I'd give it all to love that girl I'll be the one to pluck that fleur","[[0.06118906770382249, 0.07008376778103657, 0.0013245663224088428, 0.007590654329956784, 0.0009284183264639937, 0.002440631022694621, 0.006094117385455668, 0.0, 0.0013658986662386024, 0.0, 0.0017842957440108592, 0.010789729716865223, 0.005089112531101424, 0.006169623988859394, 0.0, 0.05433913938341834, 0.002915793236980818, 0.004832921900120181, 0.011646755799573237, 0.0009177528669293108, 0.002707562218185725, 0.02157909282340051, 0.012263892262839166, 0.008579016053904771, 0.00512689832902488, 0.002506633968689033, 0.0047202793737592405, 0.004354181659003905, 0.004257741934057135, 0.004382231351394092, 0.0, 0.0028006954550183027, 0.0012861898578912189, 0.0, 0.004955910421001921, 0.005241098862995334, 0.0, 0.0032703913063389183, 0.0, 0.016063830866354437, 0.0, 0.0018478336857027404, 0.0019371517320538013, 0.0, 0.025694555662550383, 0.01675538089928286, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0035623034140293253, 0.006120968155223901, 0.01089456348080517, 0.008180998684790325, 0.0, 0.002000012700119511, 0.001954213227605039, 0.0034546579118844376, 0.0, 0.0046867059439845435, 0.0022950633008889903, 0.043018171220539324, 0.006774330491778786, 0.00415641772769365, 0.0023372326453092156, 0.0015452324973666374, 0.002951456505814629, 0.0, 0.0, 0.002163916778353868, 0.0035329997429672036, 0.0020698773361162853, 0.0, 0.0011157864022706622, 0.0010619311681602233, 0.0024859028425473872, 0.0042825514059329755]]"

Talking Heads,Life During Wartime,"56 ContributorsLife During Wartime Lyrics Heard of a van that's loaded with weapons Packed up and ready to go Heard of some gravesites out by the highway A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I've lived all over this town  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now  Transmit the message to the receiver Hope for an answer some day I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime I might not ever get home  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around This ain't no Mudd Club or C.B.G.B.  I ain't got time for that now  Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.? You oughta know not to stand by the window Somebody see you up there I got some groceries, some peanut butter To last a couple of days But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones Ain't got no records to play  Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard I ain't got time for that now  Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock We blended in with the crowd We got computers, we're tapping phone lines I know that that ain't allowed We dress like students, we dress like housewives Or in a suit and a tie I changed my hairstyle so many times now I don't know what I look like  You make me shiver, I feel so tender We make a pretty good team Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving You ought to get you some sleep Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won't help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace The burning keeps me alive Get your instructions, follow directions","[[0.0016658131324915402, 0.00863201297073775, 0.0051199647931373885, 0.005850625391569227, 0.0030692951638325236, 0.0011820932387488737, 0.001296580757526688, 0.0017865052788648668, 0.0011510030701575688, 0.00217564208992541, 0.00038296333799620904, 0.0008196178668113072, 0.007720688207058835, 0.004488088175403308, 0.0, 0.002785614200325508, 0.004333352132582596, 0.0, 0.007632787343715034, 0.0024773906342178617, 0.023063942285203157, 0.0004459808020091399, 0.008336546770175783, 0.0, 0.006326715683527388, 0.0, 0.017095546111813974, 0.0, 0.0009153438422603428, 0.005942663370808152, 0.03238777640619563, 0.0, 0.008252745589106138, 0.0, 0.006707990726526825, 0.006636138552221858, 0.004491361171344447, 0.0033744890506303554, 0.0, 0.0037063903658306756, 0.003178855552706679, 0.008217175277503581, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0020726840895796974, 0.0002964862100581636, 0.0, 0.003570641906725772, 0.0018584240687274955, 0.00327457472345361, 0.0046664613070229325, 0.004167314085191254, 0.0012874214015455776, 0.0019925966867916983, 0.002925266710020111, 0.00873938668170361, 0.00292399072521252, 0.0, 0.0035351493861023983, 0.00356203030804212, 0.001235597456343697, 0.003936309656524153, 0.0, 0.007137940556425897, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0016328780348309172, 0.0, 0.0007178711883936527, 0.0, 0.00454138304703494, 0.0005830725015979472, 0.0, 0.006032669557576758]]"

Talking Heads,Crosseyed and Painless,"69 ContributorsTranslationsEspaolCrosseyed and Painless LyricsThe second track off of Talking Heads' 1980 classic addresses the idea of losing identity, and not sure how to regain it back. Lost my shape Trying to act casual Can't stop I might end up in the hospital! Changing my shape I feel like an accident They're back To explain their experience  Isn't it weird? Looks too obscure to me Wasting away That was their policy  I'm ready to leave!

We wanna wait, but here we go again  I, takes over slowly But doesn't last very long I, I, I, I, no need to worry Everything's under control O-U-T, but no hard feelings What do you know?
