Read More  Well, I've been waking up under blades, blue blossom days If only Damocles would hit me back No alabaster carvings or faces on a farthing Would prevent my head from fading to black  And it feels like falling into the sea From outer space in seconds to me And I play discordant days on repeat Until they look like harmony  When the river runs dry and the curtain is called How will I know if I can't see the bottom? Come up for air and choke on it all No one else knows that I've got a problem What if I can't get up and stand tall? What if the diamond days are all gone And who will I be when th empire falls? Wake up alon and I'll be forgotten  Well, I know I should be touring I know these chords are boring But I can't always be killing the game No golden grand pianos or voices from the shadows Will do anythin' but feel the same  And it feels like falling into the deep From somewhere way up over the peaks And I play discordant days on repeat Until the tape runs out on me  When the river runs dry and the curtain is called How will I know if I can't see the bottom? Come up for air and choke on it all No one else knows that I've got a problem What if I can't get up and stand tall? What if the diamond days are all gone And who will I be when the empire falls? Wake up alone and I'll be forgotten  And nobody told me I'd be begging for relief When what is silent to you feels like it's screaming to me Well, nobody told me I'd get tired of myself When it all looks like heaven, but it feels like hell When the river runs dry and the curtain is called How will I know if I can't see the bottom? Come up for air and choke on it all No one else knows that I've got a problem What if I can't get up and stand tall? What if the diamond days are all gone And who will I be when the empire falls?

We embroidered the memories of the time I was away Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe"" I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time"" I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed I felt aglow like this Never before and never since  If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary You and I go from one kiss to getting married Still aliv, killing time at the cemtery Never quite buried In your suit and tie, in the nick of time You low-down boy, you stand-up guy You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life You said I'm the love of your life About a million times  Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate And told me I reformed you? When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes Well, you took me to hell too And all at once, the ink bleeds A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme But I've felt a hole like this Never before and ever since  If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary What we thought was for all time was momentary Still alive, killing time at the cemetery Never quite buried You cinephile in black and white All those plot twists and dynamite Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry You said I'm the love of your life  You shit-talked me under the table Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles I wish I could un-recall How we almost had it all Dancing phantoms on the terrace Are they second-hand embarrassed That I can't get out of bed 'Cause something counterfeit's dead? It was legendary It was momentary It was unnecessary Should've let it stay buried  Oh, what a valiant roar What a bland goodbye The coward claimed he was a lion I'm combing through the braids of lies ""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind"" Our field of dreams engulfed in fire Your arson's match, your somber eyes And I'll still see it until I die You're the loss of my life"

I will not forgive you If you will not take the chance"" The sailor gave at least a try The soldier being much too wise Strategy was his strength And not disaster The sailor coming out again The lady fairly leapt at him That's how it stands today You decide if he was wise The storyteller makes no choice Soon you will not hear his voice His job is to shed light And not to master Since the end is never told We pay the teller off in gold In hopes he will come back But he cannot be bought or sold   Inspiration move me brightly Light the song with sense and color Hold away despair More than this I will not ask Faced with mysteries dark and vast Statements just seem vain at last Some rise, some fall, some climb To get to Terrapin Counting stars by candlelight All are dim but one is bright: The spiral light of Venus Rising first and shining best Oh, from the northwest corner Of a brand-new crescent moon Crickets and cicadas sing A rare and different tune Terrapin Station In the shadow of the moon Terrapin Station And I know we'll be there soon Terrapin, I can't figure out Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning Terrapin, but the train's put its brakes on And the whistle is screaming Terrapin   While you were gone These faces filled with darkness The obvious was hidden With nothing to believe in The compass always points to Terrapin Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again For good or ill again"

It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken Perhaps they're better left unsung I don't know, don't really care Let there be songs to fill the air  Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow  Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty If your cup is full, may it be again Let it be known there is a fountain That was not made by the hands of men  There is a road, no simple highway Between the dawn and the dark of night And if you go, no one may follow That path is for your steps alone  Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow  You who choose to lead must follow But if you fall you fall alone If you should stand then who's to guide you? If I knew the way I would take you home"

And ovr there, under that whit oak tree Beneath the cross is where my best buddy's buried Lasted thirteen huntin' seasons runnin' strong Keep your money 'cause a man can't leave his dog And over there is where I got down on one knee You can't buy that kind of dirt cheap""  One man smiled and he kinda looked away The other said, ""Before we go, I gotta know one thing Between the droughts and the floods through all the years What in the world got you through? How the hell'd you get here?"" And he said  ""That little girl that used to swing right there I still see her pink bow in her brown hair Runnin' up after one of them long days A big smile makin' every little worry fade And over there, under that white oak tree Beneath the cross, where my best buddy's buried All them huntin' seasons freezin' in a jon boat Me and him, double-barrel and a two-stroke And that woman that said 'yes' when I got down on one knee Yeah, you can't buy that kind of dirt cheap  No, it ain't somethin' you fall into It's somethin' God gives you And you hold on to  Just like that little girl who used to swing right there I still see her pink bow in her brown hair She's in the big city now, but she still calls home She's comin' back next week and, man, it's been too long And over there, under that white oak tree Beside the cross, where my best buddy's buried Lays a puppy posted up in the shade That woman never could turn away a stray I guess that's why she said 'yes' when I got down on one knee Oh, long as all this is here, why the hell would I ever leave? You can't buy that kind of dirt cheap"""

Am I the last of my kind?  Mama says God won't give you too much to bear That might be true in Arkansas, but I'm a long, long way from there And that whole world's an old and faded picture in my mind Am I the last of my kind?

Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend Some more again  It didn't matter what they wanted to see He thought he saw someone that looked just like me The summer memory that just never dies We worked too long and hard to give it no time He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall He cannot break it down or else he would fall One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold Take it, oh, I don't wanna sing anymore   ""I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"" I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh  And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away?

Talking Heads,Life During Wartime,"56 ContributorsLife During Wartime Lyrics Heard of a van that's loaded with weapons Packed up and ready to go Heard of some gravesites out by the highway A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I've lived all over this town  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now  Transmit the message to the receiver Hope for an answer some day I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime I might not ever get home  This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around This ain't no Mudd Club or C.B.G.B.  I ain't got time for that now  Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.? You oughta know not to stand by the window Somebody see you up there I got some groceries, some peanut butter To last a couple of days But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones Ain't got no records to play  Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard I ain't got time for that now  Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock We blended in with the crowd We got computers, we're tapping phone lines I know that that ain't allowed We dress like students, we dress like housewives Or in a suit and a tie I changed my hairstyle so many times now I don't know what I look like  You make me shiver, I feel so tender We make a pretty good team Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving You ought to get you some sleep Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won't help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace The burning keeps me alive Get your instructions, follow directions"
