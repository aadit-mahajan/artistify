first defined in 1979 but differs in that limerence can also be experienced absent a relationship while the dynamics described by nre apply to all relationships the term is particularly prevalent in the polyamorous community as people with multiple concurrent intimate relationships experience new relationship energy alongside more settled ongoing relationships adjusting to and compensating for the contrast in affect and excitement between the new and old relationships is considered an important factor in successfully balancing those relationships describing the process in a positive way can help old partners deal with feelings of jealousy towards the new partner as well as helping the person with a new partner be more understanding and conscious of maintaining their existing relationships new relationship energy is generally considered desirable perhaps nearly indispensable in forming deep emotional bonds but it can also temporarily distort perceptions and judgments and this must be taken into account these distortions of perception do not automatically imply that the attraction is unreal or will not last indeed most lasting romantic bonds do begin with nre although this does not mean that most relationships that begin with nre would lead to lasting romantic bonds because of the complications that can come with the end of nre only that the magnitude of these positive feelings is greater than it is likely to be later and some potential interpersonal problems may seem smaller than they will later become caution rather than avoidance or suppression is

possible courses of action there are different theories as to its nature free will is closely linked to the concepts of moral responsibility praise culpability and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen it is also connected with the concepts of advice persuasion deliberation and prohibition traditionally only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame whether free will exists and the implications of whether it exists or not constitute some of the longest running debates of philosophy some conceive of free will as the ability to act beyond the limits of external influences or wishes some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices undetermined by past events determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible which is inconsistent with a libertarian model of free will ancient greek philosophy identified this issue which remains a major focus of philosophical debate the view that posits free will as incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible and hard determinism the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible another incompatibilist position is hard incompatibilism which holds not only determinism but also indeterminism to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism in contrast compatibilists hold that free will is compatible with determinism some compatibilists even hold that determinism is necessary for free will arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another requiring a sense of how choices will turn out compatibilists thus consider the debate between libertarians and hard determinists over free will vs determinism a false dilemma different compatibilists offer very different definitions of what free will means and consequently find different types of constraints to be relevant to the issue classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action considering one free of will simply if had one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise one could have done otherwise without physical impediment many contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity such as to direct one s behavior in a way responsive to reason and there are still further different conceptions of free will each with their own concerns sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will", "Rebellion": "rebellion is an uprising that resists and is organized against one s government a rebel is a person who engages in a

spacetime physical energies and forces and exotic matter thus some prefer the term physicalism to materialism while others use the terms as if they were synonymous discoveries of neural correlates between consciousness and the brain are taken as empirical support for materialism but some philosophers of mind find that association fallacious or consider it compatible with non materialist ideas alternative philosophies opposed or alternative to materialism or physicalism include idealism pluralism dualism panpsychism and other forms of monism epicureanism is a philosophy of materialism from classical antiquity that was a major forerunner of modern science though ostensibly a deist epicurus affirmed the literal existence of the greek gods in either some type of celestial heaven cognate

consider to be a failure a qualified success or a neutral situation for example a film that is a commercial failure or even a box office bomb can go on to receive a cult following with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness it may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for success or failure due to ambiguous
