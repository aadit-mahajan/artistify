## Home Screen

This screen provides two text boxes: one for the user to input a *Storyline* of their choice, and the other to input the name of an *Artist* of their choice.

The specification of an artist is not necessary. If omitted, the program chooses an artist from the [Top 100 Billboard artists](https://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100/), based on their current discographies and their style of music.

The question mark menu near the top right edge of the box also gives a quick set of instructions to guide you through the application.

Once done, hit **Generate Soundtrack**!

## Loading Screen

In normal operational mode, when you specify the artist name, the loading screen should say `"Customizing with artist: [Your Artist]"`. Otherwise, the loading screen gives the prompt `"Sit tight, magic is happening!"`. Magic is really happening!

## Results Screen

Once the program has come up with a set of suggestions for your storyline, the soundtrack will be displayed in the results screen. The format of the results screen follows a simple flow, with scenes displayed along with the recommended song titles and their album/EP covers.

- To go back to the Home screen, click the **Back to input** button.
- To close the application, simply close the browser tab.

*Hope you have a good time!*
