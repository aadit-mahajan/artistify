{"Romantic love": "romance or romantic love is a feeling of love for or a strong attraction towards another person and the courtship behaviors undertaken by an individual to express those overall feelings and resultant emotions the wiley blackwell encyclopedia of family studies states that romantic love based on the model of mutual attraction and on a connection between two people that bonds them as a couple creates the conditions for overturning the model of family and marriage that it engenders this indicates that romantic love can be the founding of attraction between two people this term was primarily used by the western countries after the 1800s were socialized into love is the necessary prerequisite for starting an intimate relationship and represents the foundation on which to build the next steps in a family alternatively collins dictionary describes romantic love as an intensity and idealization of a love relationship in which the other is imbued with extraordinary virtue beauty etc so that the relationship overrides all other considerations including material ones although the emotions and sensations of romantic love are widely associated with sexual attraction they could also exist without sexual attraction in certain cases romance could even be interpreted as a normal friendship historically the term romance originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in the literature of chivalric romance people who experience little to no romantic attraction are referred to as aromantic general definitions bode kushnick undertook a comprehensive review of romantic love from a biological perspective in 2021 they considered the psychology of romantic love its mechanisms development across the lifespan functions and evolutionary history based on the content of that review they proposed a biological definition of romantic love romantic love is a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long term mating with a particular individual it occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive emotional behavioral social genetic neural and endocrine activity in both sexes throughout much of the life course it serves mate choice courtship sex and pair bonding functions it is a suite of adaptations and by products that arose sometime during the recent evolutionary history of humans anthropologist charles lindholm defined love as any intense attraction that involves the idealization of the other within an erotic context with expectation of enduring sometime into the future historical usage the word romance comes from the french vernacular where initially it indicated a verse narrative the word was originally an adverb of latin origin romanicus meaning of the roman style european medieval vernacular tales epics and ballads generally dealt with chivalric adventure not bringing in the concept of love until late into the seventeenth century the word romance developed other meanings such as the early nineteenth century spanish and italian definitions of adventurous and passionate which could intimate both love affair and idealistic quality anthropologists such as claude l\u00e9vi strauss show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies there may not be evidence however that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance marriages were often arranged but the wishes of those to be wed were considered as affection was important to primitive tribes in the majority of primitive societies studied by the anthropologists the extramarital and premarital relations between men and women were completely free the members of the temporary couples were sexually attracted to each other more than to anyone else but in all other respects their relationships had not demonstrated the characteristics of romantic love in the book of boris shipov theory of romantic love the corresponding evidences of anthropologists have been collected lewis h morgan the passion of love was unknown among the barbarians they are below the sentiment which is the offspring of civilization and super added refinement of love was unknown among the barbarians margaret mead romantic love as it occurs in our civilisation inextricably bound up with ideas of monogamy exclusiveness jealousy and undeviating fidelity does not occur in samoa bronislaw malinowski though the social code does not favour romance romantic elements and imaginative personal attachments are not altogether absent in trobriand courtship and marriage the phenomenon which b malinowski calls love actually has very little in common with the european love thus there is nothing roundabout in a trobriand wooing nor do they seek full personal relations with sexual possession only as a consequence simply and directly a meeting is asked for with the avowed intention of sexual gratification if the invitation is accepted the satisfaction of the boy s desire eliminates the romantic frame of mind the craving for the unattainable and mysterious an important point is that the pair s community of interest is limited to the sexual relation only the couple share a bed and nothing else there are no services to be mutually rendered they have no obligation to help each other in any way the aborigines of mangaia island of polynesia who mastered the english language used the word love with a completely different meaning as compared to that which is usual for the person brought up in the european culture donald s marshall mangaian informants and co workers were quite interested in the european concept of love english speaking mangaians had previously used the term only in a physical sense of sexual desire to say i love you in english to another person was tantamount to saying i want to copulate with you the components of affection and companionship which may characterize the european use of the term puzzled the mangaians when we discussed the term the principal findings that one can draw from an analysis of emotional components of sexual relationship feelings on mangaia are there is no cultural connection between a willingness to copulate with a person and any feeling of affection or liking or admiration between copulating partners the degree of passion between two individuals in sexual relationships is not related to an emotional involvement but to degrees of instruction in and use of sexual techniques nathaniel branden claims that by virtue of the tribal mentality in primitive cultures the idea of romantic love did not exist at all passionate individual attachments are evidently seen as threatening to tribal values and tribal authority dr audrey richards an anthropologist who lived among the bemba of northern rhodesia in the 1930s once related to a group of them an english folk fable about a young prince who climbed glass mountains crossed chasms and fought dragons all to obtain the hand of a maiden he loved the bemba were plainly bewildered but remained silent finally an old chief spoke up voicing the feelings of all present in the simplest of questions why not take another girl he asked the earliest recorded marriages in mesopotamia greece rome and among hebrews were used to secure alliances and produce offspring it was not until the middle ages that love began to be a real part of marriage the marriages that did arise outside of arranged marriage were most often spontaneous relationships in ladies of the leisure class rutgers university professor bonnie g smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people she writes when the young women of the nord married they did so without illusions of love and romance they acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial professional and sometimes political interests anthony giddens in the transformation of intimacy sexuality love and eroticism in modern society states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative to an individual s life and telling a story is a root meaning of the term romance according to giddens the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the novel it was then that romantic love associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love created the ties between freedom and self realization david r shumway states that the discourse of intimacy emerged in the last third of the 20th century intended to explain how marriage and other relationships worked and making the specific case that emotional closeness is much more important than passion with intimacy and romance coexisting one example of the changes experienced in relationships in the early 21st century was explored by giddens regarding homosexual relationships according to giddens since homosexuals were not able to marry they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships these kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population the origin of romantic love anthropologist and author helen fisher has argued that romantic love is a mammalian brain system evolved for selecting a preferred mating partner fisher s team has proposed that romantic love may have evolved around the time of bipedalism when new mothers needed additional protection and provision while having to carry their young a 2023 paper by adam bode has argued that while fisher s evolutionary theory has been the predominant one for 25 years romantic love could be better explained by evolutionary co option of the systems for mother infant bonding fisher likens romantic love to mammalian courtship attraction but bode argues courtship attraction is separate in f engels book the origin of the family private property and the state monogamy was the only known form of the family under which modern sex love could develop it does not follow that this love developed or even predominantly within it as the mutual love of the spouses the whole nature of strict monogamian marriage under male domination ruled this out sigmund freud stated it can easily be shown that the psychical value of erotic needs is reduced as soon as their satisfaction becomes easy an obstacle is required in order to heighten libido and where natural resistances to satisfaction have not been sufficient men have at all times erected conventional ones so as to be able to enjoy love this is true both of individuals and of nations in times in which there were no difficulties standing in the way of sexual satisfaction such as perhaps during the decline of the ancient civilizations love became worthless and life empty some believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures for example in an article presented by henry grunebaum he argues therapists mistakenly believe that romantic love is a phenomenon unique to western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the middle ages popularization of the term romance the word romance is derived from the latin adverb romanice meaning in the vernacular in reference to the languages old french and old occitan these languages were descendants of latin the language of the romans evolutions of the word romanice were used to refer first to the romance languages and eventually also to the works composed in them the genre of chivalric romance initially focused on the heroic military deeds of knights which led to the use of the word romantic in the sense of chivalrous as the genre evolved starting after the renaissance and especially in the romantic period it focused increasingly on love in the modern sense the general idea of romantic love in the western tradition is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries primarily from that of the french culture this idea is what has spurred the connection between the words romantic and lover thus coining english phrases for romantic love such as loving like the romans do the precise origins of such a connection are unknown however although the word romance or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures the general idea of romantic love appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another courtly love the conception of romantic love was popularized in western culture by the concept of courtly love knights of the middle ages were thought to have engaged in non sexual relationships with women of nobility whom they served these relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of chivalry as a moral code of conduct courtly love and the notion of domnei were often the subjects of troubadours and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time since marriage was commonly a formal arrangement courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife courtly love did not necessarily refer to those engaging in sexual acts it may also have referred to caring and emotional intimacy the bond between a knight and his lady or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served may in some cases have been one such example religious meditations upon the virgin mary were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle a lady s honor and a knight s devotion to her coupled with an obligatory respect for all women factored prominently in the identity of medieval knighthood members of the aristocracy were schooled in the principles of chivalry which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women modern historians such as d w robertson jr john c moore and e talbot donaldson consider the concept of courtly love to be a modern invention donaldson called it the myth of courtly love on the basis that it is not supported in medieval texts other scholars consider courtly love to have been purely a literary convention examples of allegorical use of the concept can be found in the middle ages but there are no historical records that offer evidence of its presence in reality historian john benton found no documentary evidence in law codes court cases chronicles or other historical documents types romantic love is contrasted with platonic love which in all usages precludes sexual relations yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully nonsexual sense rather than the classical sense in which sexual drives are sublimated unrequited love can be romantic in different ways comic tragic or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance where the spirituality of both art and egalitarian ideals is combined with strong character and emotions unrequited love is typical of the period of romanticism but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it romantic love may also be classified according to two categories popular romance and divine or spiritual romance popular romance popular romance may include but is not limited to the following types idealistic normal intense such as the emotional aspect of falling in love predictable as well as unpredictable consuming meaning consuming of time energy and emotional withdrawals and bids intense but out of control such as the aspect of falling out of love material and commercial such as societal gain mentioned in a later section of this article physical and sexual and finally grand and demonstrative divine or spiritual romance divine spiritual romance may include but is not limited to these following types realistic as well as plausible unrealistic optimistic as well as pessimistic depending upon the particular beliefs held by each person within the relationship abiding e g the theory that each person had a predetermined stance as an agent of choice such as choosing a husband or choosing a soul mate non abiding e g the theory that each person do not choose their actions and therefore their romantic love involvement has been drawn from sources outside of themselves predictable as well as unpredictable self control such as obedience and sacrifice within the context of the relationship or lack thereof such as disobedience within the context of the relationship emotional and personal soulful in the theory that the mind soul and body are one connected entity intimate and infinite such as the idea that love itself or the love of a god s unconditional love is or could be everlasting philosophy plato greek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love some of these theories are presented in plato s symposium six athenian friends including socrates drink wine and each give a speech praising the deity eros when his turn comes aristophanes says in his mythical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos two sets of human limbs genitalia on each side and two faces back to back their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender i e one masculine and masculine another feminine and feminine and the third masculine and feminine and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures assault on heaven recapitulated according to the comic playwright in other myths such as the aloadae this story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes in the final speech before alcibiades arrives socrates gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being namely the being or form of beauty ren\u00e9 girard though there are many theories of romantic love such as that of robert sternberg in which it is merely a mean combining liking and sexual desire the major theories involve far more insight for most of the 20th century freud s theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships this gave rise to a few counter theories theorists like deleuze counter freud and jacques lacan by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy ren\u00e9 girard argues that romantic attraction is a product of jealousy and rivalry particularly in a triangular form girard in any case downplays romance s individuality in favor of jealousy and the love triangle arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others a natural objection is that this is circular reasoning but girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in mimesis shakespeare s plays a midsummer night s dream as you like it and the winter s tale are the best known examples of competitive induced romance girard s theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged sexism this view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor freudian oedipal theory it may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men as a technique of attraction often combined with irony it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind instead cultivating a spirit of self sacrifice coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation directed towards the other of one s attractions constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love mimesis is always the desire to possess in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other mimetic desire is often challenged by feminists such as toril moi who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired though the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations in that sense it does resonate with capitalism and cynicism native to post modernity romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony though these were important for it in less emancipated times sexual revolutions have brought change to these areas wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role fine tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions culminating mostly in the 1960s arthur schopenhauer the process of courtship also contributed to arthur schopenhauer s pessimism despite his own romantic success and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners looking for a complement or completing of themselves in a partner as in the clich\u00e9 that opposites attract but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species but what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will to live which manifests itself in the whole species and here anticipates in the individual that these two can produce an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims world as will and representation volume 2 chapter xliv other philosophers later modern philosophers such as la rochefoucauld david hume and jean jacques rousseau also focused on morality but desire was central to french thought and hume himself tended to adopt a french worldview and temperament desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed the passions and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of passionate now equated with romantic love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of romanticism which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the absolute as well as platonic and unrequited love in german philosophy and literature french philosopher gilles deleuze linked this concept of love as a lack mainly to sigmund freud and deleuze often criticized it american views of romantic love victor c de munck and david b kronenfeld conducted a study named romantic love in the united states applying cultural models theory and methods this study was conducted through an investigation of two cultural model cases it states that in america we have a rather novel and dynamic cultural model that is falsifiable and predictive of successful love relationships which supports that it is popular for american people to successfully share feelings of romanticism with each other s partners it describes american culture by stating the model is unique in that it combines passion with comfort and friendship as properties of romantic love one of its main contributions is advising the reader that for successful romantic love relations a person would feel excited about meeting their beloved make passionate and intimate love as opposed to only physical love feel comfortable with the beloved behaving in a companionable friendly way with one s partner listen to the other s concerns offering to help out in various ways if necessary and all the while keeping a mental ledger of the degree to which altruism and passion are mutual literature shakespeare and s\u00f8ren kierkegaard share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously in tune with each other in shakespeare s measure for measure for example there has not been nor is there at this point any display of affection between isabella and the duke if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction the two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue in romeo and juliet in saying all combined save what thou must combine by holy marriage romeo implies that it is not marriage with juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically kierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as either or and stages on life s way in the first place i find it comical that all men are in love and want to be in love and yet one never can get any illumination upon the question what the lovable i e the proper object of love really is in his 2008 book how to make good decisions and be right all the time british writer iain king tried to establish rules for romance applicable across most cultures he concluded on six rules including do not flirt with someone unless you mean it do not pursue people who you are not interested in or who are not interested in you in general express your affection or uncertainty clearly unless there is a special reason not to psychology many theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love anthropologist helen fisher in her book why we love uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain norepinephrine and dopamine among other brain chemicals are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non human animals fisher uses mri to study the brain activity of a person in love and she concludes that love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger psychologist karen horney in her article the problem of the monogamous ideal indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape and the friction against sex result in non fulfillment disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non fulfillment result in a secret hostility which causes the other partner to feel alienated secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other this secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship psychologist harold bessell in his book the love test reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship bessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls romantic attraction which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors this force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners the other factor is emotional maturity which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship it can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love become disillusioned and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems romantic love in the abstract sense of the term is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a person however lisa m diamond a university of utah psychology professor proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same gender or other gender partners she also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral furthermore diamond does not state that one s sex has priority over another sex a male or female in romantic love because her theory suggests it is as possible for someone who is homosexual to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is heterosexual to fall in love with someone of the same gender in her 2012 review of this topic diamond emphasized that what is true for men may not be true for women according to diamond in most men sexual orientation is fixed and most likely innate but in many women sexual orientation may vary from 0 to 6 on the kinsey scale and back again martie haselton a psychologist at ucla considers romantic love a commitment device or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond she has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents haselton and her colleagues have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love s adaptation the first part of the experiments consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people in the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others the results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than sex research by the university of pavia suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year similar to limerence before being replaced by a more stable non passionate companionate love in companionate love changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end however research from stony brook university in new york suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer attachment patterns attachment styles that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles hazen and shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure avoidant and anxious that had previously been studied in children s attachments to their caregivers demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan later on researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment others have found that secure adult attachment leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability is characterized by low attachment related anxiety and avoidance while the fearful style is high on both dimensions the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance romantic love definition operationalization irving singer first defined love based on four greek terms eros meaning the search for beauty philia the feelings of affection in close friendships nomos the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers and agape the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers while singer did believe that love was important to world culture he did not believe that romantic love played a major role however susan hendrick and clyde hendrick at texas tech university have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life they also theorized that love in long term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years by cultural forces they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews passionate and companionate love researchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms berscheid and walster and hatfield found that these two forms can co exist either simultaneously or intermittently passionate love is an arousal driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace researchers have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used it is also estimated that passionate love as with limerence lasts for about twelve to eighteen months hendrick and hendrick studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships conversely in a study of long term marriages contreras hendrick and hendrick found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years the triangular theory of love psychologist robert sternberg developed the triangular theory of love he theorized that love is a combination of three main components passion physical arousal intimacy psychological feelings of closeness and commitment the sustaining of a relationship he also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love these include popularized forms such as romantic love intimacy and passion and consummate love passion intimacy and commitment the other forms are liking intimacy companionate love intimacy and commitment empty love commitment fatuous love passion and commitment and infatuation passion studies on sternberg s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples with passion also being an important predictor silberman 1995 on the other hand acker and davis found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction especially for long term relationships the self expansion theory of romantic love researchers arthur and elaine aron theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self concepts further their experience with eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions cognitions and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a person s self concept a study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self esteem and self efficacy than those who did not mindful relationships gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab gottman silver 1999 he used physiological and behavioral measures during couples interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship he established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval a culture of appreciation acceptance of responsibility for problems and self soothing relationship behaviors recent research suggests that romantic relationships impact daily behaviors and people are influenced by the eating habits of their romantic partners specifically in the early stages of romantic relationships women are more likely to be influenced by the eating patterns i e healthiness unhealthiness of men however when romantic relationships are established men are influenced by the eating patterns of women relationship maintenance daniel canary from the international encyclopedia of marriage describes relationship maintenance as at the most basic level relational maintenance refers to a variety of behaviors used by partners in an effort to stay together maintaining stability and quality in a relationship is the key to success in a romantic relationship he says that simply staying together is not sufficient instead the quality of the relationship is important for researchers this means examining behaviors that are linked to relational satisfaction and other indicators of quality canary suggests using the work of john gottman an american physiologist best known for his research on marital stability for over four decades serves as a guide for predicting outcomes in relationships because gottman emphasizes behaviors that determine whether or not a couple gets divorced furthermore canary also uses the source from stafford and canary a journal on communication monographs because they created five great strategies based on maintaining quality in a relationship the article s strategies are to provide positivity being joyful and optimistic not criticizing each other assurances proving one s commitment and love openness to be honest with one another according to what they want in the relationship social networks efforts into involving friends and family in their activities sharing tasks complementing each other s needs based on daily work on relational maintenance steven mccornack and joseph ortiz the authors of the book choices connection state that relationship maintenance refers to the use of communication behaviors to keep a relationship strong and to ensure that each party continues to draw satisfaction from the relationship physiology researchers such as feeney and noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from two weeks to eight months found that one out of four adults attachment style changed furthermore a study by lopez and gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self confidence ratings and coping styles on the other hand attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships in addition research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy enjoyment of positive social events and stress management providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships another topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of domestic abuse following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival it can be said that in some instances it has turned into a maladaptation oxytocin ot is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain it is known to cause a decrease in stress response it also can cause an increase in feelings of attachment in the beginning stages of a romantic relationship ot levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship the higher the surge of ot the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together it plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust altruism empathy etc this response is not universal and can in fact cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual individuals ranked high in rejection sensitivity exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance the feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals the obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in kin selection theory where by exhibiting aggressive behavior a mate can use intimidation and dominance to ward off other potential predators thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring this has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship is now causing one partner to harm the other in the search for the root of intimate partner violence ipv intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in five behaviors towards their romantic partner what they found was that oxytocin increased ipv inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies see also references further reading loudin

beloved the beloved may not be aware of the admirer s deep affection or may consciously reject it knowing that the admirer admires them merriam webster defines unrequited as not reciprocated or returned in kind psychiatrist eric berne said in his book sex in human loving that some say that one sided love is better than none but like half a loaf of bread it is likely to grow hard and moldy sooner the philosopher friedrich nietzsche contends that indispensable to the lover is his unrequited love which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference unrequited love stands in contrast to redamancy the act of reciprocal love which is the tendency for people to like others who express a liking for them analysis route to unrequited love according to dr roy baumeister what makes a person desirable is a complex and highly personal mix of many qualities and traits but falling for someone who is much more desirable than oneself whether because of physical beauty or attributes like charm intelligence wit or status baumeister calls this kind of mismatch prone to find their love unrequited and that such relationships are falling upward platonic friendships provide a fertile soil for unrequited love thus the object of unrequited love is often a friend or acquaintance someone regularly encountered in the workplace during the course of work school or other activities involving large groups of people this creates an awkward situation in which the admirer has difficulty in expressing their true feelings a fear that revelation of feelings might invite rejection cause embarrassment or might end all access to the beloved as a romantic relationship may be inconsistent with the existing association rejectors there are two bad sides to unrequited love but only one is made familiar by our culture that of the lover not the rejector in fact research suggests that the object of unrequited affection experiences a variety of negative emotions exceeding those of the suitor including anxiety frustration and guilt as freud pointed out when a woman sues for love to reject and refuse is a distressing part for a man to play advantages unrequited love has long been depicted as noble an unselfish and stoic willingness to accept suffering literary and artistic depictions of unrequited love may depend on assumptions of social distance that have less relevance in western democratic societies with relatively high social mobility and less rigid codes of sexual fidelity nonetheless the literary record suggests a degree of euphoria in the feelings associated with unrequited love which has the advantage as well of carrying none of the responsibilities of mutual relationships certainly rejection apparent or real may be the catalyst for inspired literary creation the poetry of frustration eric berne considered that the man who is loved by a woman is lucky indeed but the one to be envied is he who loves however little he gets in return how

slang when it is initiated by one partner the term is less likely to be applied to a married couple where a breakup is typically called a separation or divorce when a couple engaged to be married breaks up it is typically called a broken engagement people commonly think of breakups in a romantic aspect however there are also non romantic and platonic breakups and this type of relationship dissolution is usually caused by failure to maintain a friendship susie orbach 1992 has argued that the dissolution of dating and cohabiting relationships can be as painful as or more painful than divorce because these nonmarital relationships are less socially recognized kamiar k rueckert argues with the works of donald winnicott that the ability to be alone is an essentially healthy sign of emotional development and maturity once a child has obtained closeness and attachment by their early caregivers they are able to develop autonomy and identity if children have not introjected the good and protective qualities of their parents they will fear separation and break ups models several psychological models have been proposed to explain the process of a relationship breakup many suggesting that relationship dissolution occurs in stages mark l knapp a foundational scholar on the subject of interpersonal relationships created a model called knapp s relational development model he describes two separate phases of relationships coming together and coming apart the coming together phase is meant to be long term beginning in the initiation phase and becoming deeper with time and intimacy in the coming apart phase differentiating begins this is when the individuals began noticing differences that may seem unnegotiable or place pressure on the relationship this leads to circumscribing where the individuals begin to pull apart set boundaries and have their own independent lives this may cause issues to arise at this point the relationship reaches stagnation where the couple stays together for other reasons rather than their will to do so examples include children the next stage is avoidance in which the individuals try to stay away from each other as much as possible they then reach termination where the relationship is over and they go their separate ways stages leading to a breakup l lee proposes that there are five stages ultimately leading up to a breakup cycle of a breakup steve duck outlines a six stage cycle of relationship breakup factors that predict a breakup before marriage hill rubin and peplau identify five factors that predict breakup before marriage cascade model of relational dissolution gottman and levenson 1994 outline the cascade model of relational dissolution in which four negative nonverbal behaviors lead to the breakdown of a marriage relationship uncoupling theory in 1976 sociologist diane vaughan proposed an uncoupling theory where there exists a turning point in the dynamics of relationship breakup a precise moment when they knew the relationship was over when everything went dead inside followed by a transition period in which one partner unconsciously knows the relationship is going to end but holds on to it for an extended period even for years vaughan considered that the process of breakup was asymmetrical for initiator and respondent the former has begun mourning the loss of the relationship and has undertaken something tantamount to a rehearsal mentally and to varying degrees experientially of a life apart from the partner the latter then has to play catch up to make their own transition out of the relationship partners must redefine initiator and relationship negatively legitimating the dissolution as a result for vaughan getting out of a relationship includes a redefinition of self at several levels in the private thoughts of the individual between partners and in the larger social context in which the relationship exists she considered that uncoupling is complete when the partners have defined themselves and are defined by others as separate and independent of each other when being partners is no longer a major source of identity conscious uncoupling katherine woodward thomas a licensed marriage and family therapist originated the term conscious uncoupling in 2009 thomas began teaching this new approach to divorce to students throughout the world the term received popularization by gwyneth paltrow who used the phrase to describe her divorce with chris martin paltrow had her doctors dr sherry sami and habib sadeghi and his wife explain the conscious uncoupling when she first made the news of her divorce public a conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument within a marriage was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing habib sadeghi explained from this perspective there are no bad guys just two people it s about people as individuals not just the relationship consequences depending on the individual breakups can be stressful unpleasant and traumatic events both parties could feel a large number of negative effects as a result of the relationship s dissolution and these events often gain the reputation for being some of the worst events in people s lives these could include psychological distress symptoms grief reactions an overall decline in psychological well being and potential stalking behaviors individuals often work hard to keep their relationships intact because of how significantly distressing and problematic these negative effects can be even in the face of potential complications in their relationship for as long as they can bear it negative effects psychological distress symptoms individuals who had just recently experienced the dissolution of a romantic relationship reported several symptoms of acute psychological distress these included flashback and intrusive memories associated with their partner often triggered by important dates associated with either the relationship or the breakup these intrusive distress symptoms manifested in various ways for both the individual who initiated the breakup and their partner such as being reminded of certain aspects of their behavior or their preferences another set of psychological distress symptoms that were reported by individuals who had experienced a romantic relationship breakup fell under the category of avoidance behavior being without their partner causes their self concept to shift as they struggle through emotional distress this involves an active attempt at denying or ignoring the circumstances of the current situation or those that led to the dissolution of the relationship in relation to this individuals also noted feeling numb and uninterested with the world around them because of the breakup the combination of this desire to engage in avoidance behaviors and the intrusive memories that may naturally come up cause individuals to feel significant emotional swings and outbursts in the form of irritation anger and startle responses individuals were noted as being far more paranoid suspicious and jealous often tied towards a desire to know information about their ex partner overall these psychological distress symptoms come together to result in a significantly lower level of self esteem among individuals who have just undergone the dissolution of a romantic relationship additionally individuals undergo a significant redefinition of their self concept as they attempt to understand who they are without their ex partner this compounds upon the psychological distress symptoms that they feel from the loss of the relationship and is the most significant negative effect that people undergoing a breakup experience grief reactions a natural effect of the loss of a relationship that an individual had hoped to keep is grief because the desire to keep relationships intact despite problems and complications is a natural human desire this results in individuals undergoing a breakup displaying grief reactions that include symptoms like sleeplessness depression and suicidal thoughts this tendency to express grief and depression is so prevalent that researchers point to it being a significant contributor to the first onset of major depressive disorder in young adults the extent of these grief reactions is not limited to the time frame immediately following the dissolution of the romantic relationship even some time after the breakup people who are asked to recall depressing or negative events in their lives commonly make reference to traumatic events of this nature this negative effect can be attributed to the severity of the grief reaction that people who suffer through a breakup display making a significant mark in their lives that they are unlikely to forget decline in psychological well being in addition to these specific negative effects individuals who are suffering through a breakup report a general decline in their psychological well being the general negative emotion that they feel often triggers other behaviors and habits that are either detrimental to their mental health or signify poor mental health conditions these include increased alcohol use weight loss worsening physical health admissions to psychiatric services increased criminal behavior increased risk of suicide negative emotions and feelings such as guilt anger or rejection stalking behaviors a behavior that has been noticed following some breakups is the prevalence of stalking as one partner attempts to maintain contact with the other however unwanted it may be this type of behavior exists on a scale that stretches from an amicable breakup with no unwanted harassment behaviors all the way to stalking behaviors that are threatening and distressful to the partner this behavior stems from an unhappiness with the circumstances following the dissolution of the relationship as well as a misguided belief that the stalking behavior may result in the reforming of the relationship there is no clear definition of stalking behavior that differentiate it from socially acceptable activities they become more sinister when they are unwanted and form a persistent pattern positive effects evidence shows that even in the direst of situations there is a chance for positive emotions and growth breakups are no different giving victims opportunities for stress related growth improving their performance in future relationships and providing feelings of relief and freedom jessica kansky and joseph p allen conducted a study that followed 160 20 to 25 year olds or emerging adults and observed their romantic and close friend relationships there were a significant number of findings but one finding was that the experience of a break up did prove positive in the long run for several individuals especially if they knew the reason s the relationship ended stress related growth individuals that are placed under stressful situations are often faced with an opportunity for growth and development as a result of this stress without this push to improve individuals are often pushed towards complacency and refuse to make the necessary efforts to progress through life different ways in which people have exhibited growth following a stressful life event include improvements to the way a person views themselves the way they connect with other people around them or their overall approach to life research shows that breakups are highly representative of this type of stressful situation as individuals experience them several times throughout their lives and have been known to self report instances of growth because of the experience improved future relationships another positive outcome that has been observed to follow breakup has to do with the lessons that people may have learned from going through the painful experience the stress related growth that a person is forced to experience following a breakup causes improvements to their overall character self image and ability to interact with others these improvements have the potential to improve the quality of future romantic relationships with other people this is due to the increased level of maturity displayed by the individual as well as to a lesser extent insight into certain things that they must avoid in a relationship to ensure better relationships in the future feelings of relief and freedom while this may not necessarily be a universal positive consequence that affects all people going through a breakup there is significant evidence towards certain individuals experiencing feelings of relief freedom and happiness following the end of a relationship there is a high likelihood that these individuals were the one who initiated the breakup in the first place but research has shown that there have been cases where individuals that have been victims of a breakup recognize that their past relationship was sub optimal which allows them to display the same emotions of relief freedom and happiness mitigating factors while individuals that have experienced a breakup are likely to experience a number of different positive and negative effects once the relationship has run its course different people can expect these to manifest in varying degrees this is because there are several mitigating factors that can either minimize or amplify the extent to which one feels the consequences of a breakup the list of potential factors that have been shown to moderate the effects that an individual might feel are categorized and listed below relationship quality duration of relationship longer relationships are more likely to be more painful after the breakup admission of love for ex partner relationships that report to be filled with love may exacerbate the consequences that victims feel following a breakup satisfaction levels of both parties relationships that report both parties feeling satisfied are more likely to suffer during breakups level of investment in maintaining the relationship high levels of relationship investment translate to a much larger loss caused by the dissolution of the romantic relationship proportion of positive and negative relationship memories individuals that had a high number of positive relationship memories were less negatively affected by the breakup when compared to those that would constantly dredge up negative memories of their ex partner romantic situation following breakup ease of finding an alternative partner being able to find a new partner immediately following a breakup allowed the individual to better weather the negative emotions and problems associated with the dissolution of a romantic relationship willingness to begin a new relationship an openness to the formation of a new relationship was shown to translate to a lower level of victimization and negative consequences after a breakup circumstances of the breakup initiator of the dissolution of the relationship while both the initiator and the victim were shown to experience consequences following the breakup the former displayed less of these symptoms and in some cases experienced positive effects because the relationship ended certainty of the reasons for the breakup being unsure about the initiator s reasons for breaking up caused higher levels of anxiety and other stress symptoms in the victim while achieving closure was an important step for most individuals seeking to move on from a breakup characteristics of the participants hardiness individuals that displayed above average levels of hardiness were unfazed by the dissolution of their romantic relationship and were less likely to be bothered by its consequences attachment styles can play a big role in why a breakup occurs in the first place attachment styles define the expectations an individual has when in a relationship based on the relationship they had with their caregivers during childhood the four attachment styles are avoidant attachment which is characterized by avoiding communication and withdrawing anxious ambivalent attachment which is characterized by fear that a partner will not reciprocate the same love that the individual gives fearful avoidant disorganized attachment which is characterized by a fear of relationships and attempts to avoid them even while craving love and intimacy and secure attachment which is the style that is characterized by strong healthy relationships these attachment styles can affect the behavior of one partner towards another and different attachment styles can clash for instance if one partner has an avoidant attachment and dates someone with a secure attachment style the two partners may clash due to a lack of communication and several misunderstandings as these attachment styles come with expectations that are acted out in behavior that can eventually lead to a breakup self esteem levels high levels of self esteem allow people to be less stressed during the dissolution of a relationship and alleviate the most severe negative consequences mental health individuals that display lower levels of mental health and substance abuse have reported magnified consequence levels when going through the breakup process self complexity people that exhibit a complex self image which references an ability to perceive oneself as more than just who they are in their romantic relationship are less likely to be debilitated by the consequences of a breakup sex several studies observed that females on average exhibited larger negative symptoms during the breakup process implementation of coping strategies distancing avoiding the problem has been observed to translate to negative coping outcomes and a worsening of the consequences reported by the victim while a willingness to confront the matter and engage in problem solving has shown overall mitigative effects to breakup consequences benefit finding the willingness to objectively assess the relationship as well as an ability to find benefits that resulted from its ending allowed victims to display less stress symptoms during the breakup perceived social support individuals that felt like people in their social group were on their side and would support them during this stressful time reported being less affected by the breakup and loss of a romantic relationship online breakups the technologically advanced society that currently exists means that much of people s lives are online people can date online via dating apps or using social media platforms such as instagram or facebook many relationships have been able to manifest from mediated communication and last a similar amount of time as relationships that were started in person others however have not been as long lived the presence of social media and technology also plays a part in relationships that began and exist in person as well there has been much controversy about the stress that online dating places on relationships the constant and wide range of accessibility provided by technology and internet access can lead to a plethora of issues that may result in break ups an example of this is that those already in a relationship can have multiple partners that are also dating using online platforms that have no knowledge of each other due to the unlimited access they have to meet people from all over the world once a partner discovers the infidelity this could result in a breakup online dating may also prohibit choices that could save a relationship to further elaborate many times in relationships space is necessary to collect thoughts and feelings after an argument however the usage of social media allows access to one s partner at all times this constant accessibility may result in disruption of both space and boundaries necessary for a healthy relationship lgbtq relationship dissolutions while public opinion has become more accepting of different forms of relationships including those that are not heterosexual lgbtq couples often face adversity when it comes to maintaining their relationships due to societal based homophobia according to researchers lahti and kolehmainen studies have shown that lgbtq couples tend to feel pressured by society to maintain long monogamous and healthy relationships they may struggle in silence and refuse to seek help or end a relationship when it may be in their best interest mentally and emotionally because of this pressure their studies also indicate that most counseling services or other means of salvaging a relationship have heteronormative assumptions this makes it difficult for lgbtq couples to find help for their relationships that caters to the issues they struggle with personally other unique issues arise out of lgbtq relationship dissolutions when children are involved according to researchers goldberg and allen lgbtq separations involving children can become legally confusing in lesbian relationships there are two mothers so the question arises of who would receive full custody of the child ren many times the court system favors the birth mother however in lesbian relationships one mother could carry the egg of another so it becomes challenging to determine who the child ren biologically belongs to in gay male relationship dissolutions this also causes confusion as the majority of gay male parents adopted their children due to the heteronormative society that currently exists lgbtq couples often deal with challenges post break up there is a lack of research on lgbtq relationship dissolutions as these relationships are fairly recent to acceptance and legality in history see also broken heart

"Longing (emotion)": "desires are states of mind that are expressed by terms like wanting wishing longing or craving a great variety of features is commonly associated with desires they are seen as propositional attitudes towards conceivable states of affairs they aim to change the world by representing how the world should be unlike beliefs which aim to represent how the world actually is desires are closely related to agency they motivate the agent to realize them for this to be possible a desire has to be combined with a belief about which action would realize it desires present their objects in a favorable light as something that appears to be good their fulfillment is normally experienced as pleasurable in contrast to the negative experience of failing to do so conscious desires are usually accompanied by some form of emotional response while many researchers roughly agree on these general features there is significant disagreement about how to define desires i e which of these features are essential and which ones are merely accidental action based theories define desires as structures that incline us toward actions pleasure based theories focus on the tendency of desires to cause pleasure when fulfilled value based theories identify desires with attitudes toward values like judging or having an appearance that something is good desires can be grouped into various types according to a few basic distinctions intrinsic desires concern what the subject wants for its own sake while instrumental desires are about what the subject wants for the sake of something else occurrent desires are either conscious or otherwise causally active in contrast to standing desires which exist somewhere in the back of one s mind propositional desires are directed at possible states of affairs while object desires are directly about objects various authors distinguish between higher desires associated with spiritual or religious goals and lower desires which are concerned with bodily or sensory pleasures desires play a role in many different fields there is disagreement whether desires should be understood as practical reasons or whether we can have practical reasons without having a desire to follow them according to fitting attitude theories of value an object is valuable if it is fitting to desire this object or if we ought to desire it desire satisfaction theories of well being state that a person s well being is determined by whether that person s desires are satisfied marketing and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers into buying a given product or service techniques include creating a sense of lack in the viewer or associating the product with desirable attributes desire plays a key role in art the theme of desire is at the core of romance novels which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by social conventions class or cultural barriers melodrama films use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing crises of human emotion failed romance or friendship in which desire is thwarted or unrequited theories theories of desire aim to define desires in terms of their essential features a great variety of features are ascribed to desires like that they are propositional attitudes that they lead to actions that their fulfillment tends to bring pleasure etc across the different theories of desires there is a broad agreement about what these features are their disagreement concerns which of these features belong to the essence of desires and which ones are merely accidental or contingent traditionally the two most important theories define desires in terms of dispositions to cause actions or concerning their tendency to bring pleasure upon being fulfilled an important alternative of more recent origin holds that desiring something means seeing the object of desire as valuable general features a great variety of features is ascribed to desires they are usually seen as attitudes toward conceivable states of affairs often referred to as propositional attitudes they differ from beliefs which are also commonly seen as propositional attitudes by their direction of fit both beliefs and desires are representations of the world but while beliefs aim at truth i e to represent how the world actually is desires aim to change the world by representing how the world should be these two modes of representation have been termed mind to world and world to mind direction of fit respectively desires can be either positive in the sense that the subject wants a desirable state to be the case or negative in the sense that the subject wants an undesirable state not to be the case it is usually held that desires come in varying strengths some things are desired more strongly than other things we desire things in regard to some features they have but usually not in regard to all of their features desires are also closely related to agency we normally try to realize our desires when acting it is usually held that desires by themselves are not sufficient for actions they have to be combined with beliefs the desire to own a new mobile phone for example can only result in the action of ordering one online if paired with the belief that ordering it would contribute to the desire being fulfilled the fulfillment of desires is normally experienced as pleasurable in contrast to the negative experience of failing to do so but independently of whether the desire is fulfilled or not there is a sense in which the desire presents its object in a favorable light as something that appears to be good besides causing actions and pleasures desires also have various effects on the mental life one of these effects is to frequently move the subject s attention to the object of desire specifically to its positive features another effect of special interest to psychology is the tendency of desires to promote reward based learning for example in the form of operant conditioning action based theories action based or motivational theories have traditionally been dominant they can take different forms but they all have in common that they define desires as structures that incline us toward actions this is especially relevant when ascribing desires not from a first person perspective but from a third person perspective action based theories usually include some reference to beliefs in their definition for example that to desire that p is to be disposed to bring it about that p assuming one s beliefs are true despite their popularity and their usefulness for empirical investigations action based theories face various criticisms these criticisms can roughly be divided into two groups on the one hand there are inclinations to act that are not based on desires evaluative beliefs about what we should do for example incline us toward doing it even if we do not want to do it there are also mental disorders that have a similar effect like the tics associated with tourette syndrome on the other hand there are desires that do not incline us toward action these include desires for things we cannot change for example a mathematician s desire that the number pi be a rational number in some extreme cases such desires may be very common for example a totally paralyzed person may have all kinds of regular desires but lacks any disposition to act due to the paralysis pleasure based theories it is one important feature of desires that their fulfillment is pleasurable pleasure based or hedonic theories use this feature as part of their definition of desires according to one version to desire p is to be disposed to take pleasure in it seeming that p and displeasure in it seeming that not p hedonic theories avoid many of the problems faced by action based theories they allow that other things besides desires incline us to actions and they have no problems explaining how a paralyzed person can still have desires but they also come with new problems of their own one is that it is usually assumed that there is a causal relation between desires and pleasure the satisfaction of desires is seen as the cause of the resulting pleasure but this is only possible if cause and effect are two distinct things not if they are identical apart from this there may also be bad or misleading desires whose fulfillment does not bring the pleasure they originally seemed to promise value based theories value based theories are of more recent origin than action based theories and hedonic theories they identify desires with attitudes toward values cognitivist versions sometimes referred to as desire as belief theses equate desires with beliefs that something is good thereby categorizing desires as one type of belief but such versions face the difficulty of explaining how we can have beliefs about what we should do despite not wanting to do it a more promising approach identifies desires not with value beliefs but with value seemings on this view to desire to have one more drink is the same as it seeming good to the subject to have one more drink but such a seeming is compatible with the subject having the opposite belief that having one more drink would be a bad idea a closely related theory is due to t m scanlon who holds that desires are judgments of what we have reasons to do critics have pointed out that value based theories have difficulties explaining how animals like cats or dogs can have desires since they arguably cannot represent things as being good in the relevant sense others a great variety of other theories of desires have been proposed attention based theories take the tendency of attention to keep returning to the desired object as the defining feature of desires learning based theories define desires in terms of their tendency to promote reward based learning for example in the form of operant conditioning functionalist theories define desires in terms of the causal roles played by internal states while interpretationist theories ascribe desires to persons or animals based on what would best explain their behavior holistic theories combine various of the aforementioned features in their definition of desires types desires can be grouped into various types according to a few basic distinctions something is desired intrinsically if the subject desires it for its own sake otherwise the desire is instrumental or extrinsic occurrent desires are causally active while standing desires exist somewhere in the back of one s mind propositional desires are directed at possible states of affairs in contrast to object desires which are directly about objects intrinsic and instrumental the distinction between intrinsic and instrumental or extrinsic desires is central to many issues concerning desires something is desired intrinsically if the subject desires it for its own sake pleasure is a common object of intrinsic desires according to psychological hedonism it is the only thing desired intrinsically intrinsic desires have a special status in that they do not depend on other desires they contrast with instrumental desires in which something is desired for the sake of something else for example haruto enjoys movies which is why he has an intrinsic desire to watch them but in order to watch them he has to step into his car navigate through the traffic to the nearby cinema wait in line pay for the ticket etc he desires to do all these things as well but only in an instrumental manner he would not do all these things were it not for his intrinsic desire to watch the movie it is possible to desire the same thing both intrinsically and instrumentally at the same time so if haruto was a driving enthusiast he might have both an intrinsic and an instrumental desire to drive to the cinema instrumental desires are usually about causal means to bring the object of another desire about driving to the cinema for example is one of the causal requirements for watching the movie there but there are also constitutive means besides causal means constitutive means are not causes but ways of doing something watching the movie while sitting in seat 13f for example is one way of watching the movie but not an antecedent cause desires corresponding to constitutive means are sometimes termed realizer desires occurrent and standing occurrent desires are desires that are currently active they are either conscious or at least have unconscious effects for example on the subject s reasoning or behavior desires we engage in and try to realize are occurrent but we have many desires that are not relevant to our present situation and do not influence us currently such desires are called standing or dispositional they exist somewhere in the back of our minds and are different from not desiring at all despite lacking causal effects at the moment if dhanvi is busy convincing her friend to go hiking this weekend for example then her desire to go hiking is occurrent but many of her other desires like to sell her old car or to talk with her boss about a promotion are merely standing during this conversation standing desires remain part of the mind even while the subject is sound asleep it has been questioned whether standing desires should be considered desires at all in a strict sense one motivation for raising this doubt is that desires are attitudes toward contents but a disposition to have a certain attitude is not automatically an attitude itself desires can be occurrent even if they do not influence our behavior this is the case for example if the agent has a conscious desire to do something but successfully resists it this desire is occurrent because it plays some role in the agents mental life even if it is not action guiding propositional desires and object desires the dominant view is that all desires are to be understood as propositional attitudes but a contrasting view allows that at least some desires are directed not at propositions or possible states of affairs but directly at objects this difference is also reflected on a linguistic level object desires can be expressed through a direct object for example louis desires an omelet propositional desires on the other hand are usually expressed through a that clause for example arielle desires that she has an omelet for breakfast propositionalist theories hold that direct object expressions are just a short form for that clause expressions while object desire theorists contend that they correspond to a different form of desire one argument in favor of the latter position is that talk of object desire is very common and natural in everyday language but one important objection to this view is that object desires lack proper conditions of satisfaction necessary for desires conditions of satisfaction determine under which situations a desire is satisfied arielle s desire is satisfied if the that clause expressing her desire has been realized i e she is having an omelet for breakfast but louis s desire is not satisfied by the mere existence of omelets nor by his coming into possession of an omelet at some indeterminate point in his life so it seems that when pressed for the details object desire theorists have to resort to propositional expressions to articulate what exactly these desires entail this threatens to collapse object desires into propositional desires higher and lower in religion and philosophy a distinction is sometimes made between higher and lower desires higher desires are commonly associated with spiritual or religious goals in contrast to lower desires sometimes termed passions which are concerned with bodily or sensory pleasures this difference is closely related to john stuart mill s distinction between the higher pleasures of the mind and the lower pleasures of the body in some religions all desires are outright rejected as a negative influence on our well being the second noble truth in buddhism for example states that desiring is the cause of all suffering a related doctrine is also found in the hindu tradition of karma yoga which recommends that we act without a desire for the fruits of our actions referred to as nishkam karma but other strands in hinduism explicitly distinguish lower or bad desires for worldly things from higher or good desires for closeness or oneness with god this distinction is found for example in the bhagavad gita or in the tradition of bhakti yoga a similar line of thought is present in the teachings of christianity in the doctrine of the seven deadly sins for example various vices are listed which have been defined as perverse or corrupt versions of love explicit reference to bad forms of desiring is found for example in the sins of lust gluttony and greed the seven sins are contrasted with the seven virtues which include the corresponding positive counterparts a desire for god is explicitly encouraged in various doctrines existentialists sometimes distinguish between authentic and inauthentic desires authentic desires express what the agent truly wants from deep within an agent wants something inauthentically on the other hand if the agent is not fully identified with this desire despite having it roles desire is a quite fundamental concept as such it is relevant for many different fields various definitions and theories of other concepts have been expressed in terms of desires actions depend on desires and moral praiseworthiness is sometimes defined in terms of being motivated by the right desire a popular contemporary approach defines value as that which it is fitting to desire desire satisfaction theories of well being state that a person s well being is determined by whether that person s desires are satisfied it has been suggested that to prefer one thing to another is just to have a stronger desire for the former thing an influential theory of personhood holds that only entities with higher order desires can be persons action practical reasons and morality desires play a central role in actions as what motivates them it is usually held that a desire by itself is not sufficient it has to be combined with a belief that the action in question would contribute to the fulfillment of the desire the notion of practical reasons is closely related to motivation and desire some philosophers often from a humean tradition simply identify an agent s desires with the practical reasons he has a closely related view holds that desires are not reasons themselves but present reasons to the agent a strength of these positions is that they can give a straightforward explanation of how practical reasons can act as motivation but an important objection is that we may have reasons to do things without a desire to do them this is especially relevant in the field of morality peter singer for example suggests that most people living in developed countries have a moral obligation to donate a significant portion of their income to charities such an obligation would constitute a practical reason to act accordingly even for people who feel no desire to do so a closely related issue in morality asks not what reasons we have but for what reasons we act this idea goes back to immanuel kant who holds that doing the right thing is not sufficient from the moral perspective instead we have to do the right thing for the right reason he refers to this distinction as the difference between legality legalit\u00e4t i e acting in accordance with outer norms and morality moralit\u00e4t i e being motivated by the right inward attitude on this view donating a significant portion of one s income to charities is not a moral action if the motivating desire is to improve one s reputation by convincing other people of one s wealth and generosity instead from a kantian perspective it should be performed out of a desire to do one s duty these issues are often discussed in contemporary philosophy under the terms of moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness one important position in this field is that the praiseworthiness of an action depends on the desire motivating this action value and well being it is common in axiology to define value in relation to desire such approaches fall under the category of fitting attitude theories according to them an object is valuable if it is fitting to desire this object or if we ought to desire it this is sometimes expressed by saying that the object is desirable appropriately desired or worthy of desire two important aspects of this type of position are that it reduces values to deontic notions or what we ought to feel and that it makes values dependent on human responses and attitudes despite their popularity fitting attitude theories of value face various theoretical objections an often cited one is the wrong kind of reason problem which is based on the consideration that facts independent of the value of an object may affect whether this object ought to be desired in one thought experiment an evil demon threatens the agent to kill her family unless she desires him in such a situation it is fitting for the agent to desire the demon in order to save her family despite the fact that the demon does not possess positive value well being is usually considered a special type of value the well being of a person is what is ultimately good for this person desire satisfaction theories are among the major theories of well being they state that a person s well being is determined by whether that person s desires are satisfied the higher the number of satisfied desires the higher the well being one problem for some versions of desire theory is that not all desires are good some desires may even have terrible consequences for the agent desire theorists have tried to avoid this objection by holding that what matters are not actual desires but the desires the agent would have if she was fully informed preferences desires and preferences are two closely related notions they are both conative states that determine our behavior the difference between the two is that desires are directed at one object while preferences concern a comparison between two alternatives of which one is preferred to the other the focus on preferences instead of desires is very common in the field of decision theory it has been argued that desire is the more fundamental notion and that preferences are to be defined in terms of desires for this to work desire has to be understood as involving a degree or intensity given this assumption a preference can be defined as a comparison of two desires that nadia prefers tea over coffee for example just means that her desire for tea is stronger than her desire for coffee one argument for this approach is due to considerations of parsimony a great number of preferences can be derived from a very small number of desires one objection to this theory is that our introspective access is much more immediate in cases of preferences than in cases of desires so it is usually much easier for us to know which of two options we prefer than to know the degree with which we desire a particular object this consideration has been used to suggest that maybe preference and not desire is the more fundamental notion persons personhood and higher order desires personhood is what persons have there are various theories about what constitutes personhood most agree that being a person has to do with having certain mental abilities and is connected to having a certain moral and legal status an influential theory of persons is due to harry frankfurt he defines persons in terms of higher order desires many of the desires we have like the desire to have ice cream or to take a vacation are first order desires higher order desires on the other hand are desires about other desires they are most prominent in cases where a person has a desire he does not want to have a recovering addict for example may have both a first order desire to take drugs and a second order desire of not following this first order desire or a religious ascetic may still have sexual desires while at the same time wanting to be free of these desires according to frankfurt having second order volitions i e second order desires about which first order desires are followed is the mark of personhood it is a form of caring about oneself of being concerned with who one is and what one does not all entities with a mind have higher order volitions frankfurt terms them wantons in contrast to persons on his view animals and maybe also some human beings are wantons formation both psychology and philosophy are interested in where desires come from or how they form an important distinction for this investigation is between intrinsic desires i e what the subject wants for its own sake and instrumental desires i e what the subject wants for the sake of something else instrumental desires depend for their formation and existence on other desires for example aisha has a desire to find a charging station at the airport this desire is instrumental because it is based on another desire to keep her mobile phone from dying without the latter desire the former would not have come into existence as an additional requirement a possibly unconscious belief or judgment is necessary to the effect that the fulfillment of the instrumental desire would somehow contribute to the fulfillment of the desire it is based on instrumental desires usually pass away after the desires they are based on cease to exist but defective cases are possible where often due to absentmindedness the instrumental desire remains such cases are sometimes termed motivational inertia something like this might be the case when the agent finds himself with a desire to go to the kitchen only to realize upon arriving that he does not know what he wants there intrinsic desires on the other hand do not depend on other desires some authors hold that all or at least some intrinsic desires are inborn or innate for example desires for pleasure or for nutrition but other authors suggest that even these relatively basic desires may depend to some extent on experience before we can desire a pleasurable object we have to learn through a hedonic experience of this object for example that it is pleasurable but it is also conceivable that reason by itself generates intrinsic desires on this view reasoning to the conclusion that it would be rational to have a certain intrinsic desire causes the subject to have this desire it has also been proposed that instrumental desires may be transformed into intrinsic desires under the right conditions this could be possible through processes of reward based learning the idea is that whatever reliably predicts the fulfillment of intrinsic desires may itself become the object of an intrinsic desire so a baby may initially only instrumentally desire its mother because of the warmth hugs and milk she provides but over time this instrumental desire may become an intrinsic desire the death of desire thesis holds that desires cannot continue to exist once their object is realized this would mean that an agent cannot desire to have something if he believes that he already has it one objection to the death of desire thesis comes from the fact that our preferences usually do not change upon desire satisfaction so if samuel prefers to wear dry clothes rather than wet clothes he would continue to hold this preference even after having come home from a rainy day and having changed his clothes this would indicate against the death of desire thesis that no change on the level of the agent s conative states takes place philosophy in philosophy desire has been identified as a philosophical problem since antiquity in the republic plato argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal in de anima aristotle claims that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion at the same time he acknowledges that reasoning also interacts with desire thomas hobbes 1588 1679 proposed the concept of psychological hedonism which asserts that the fundamental motivation of all human action is the desire for pleasure baruch spinoza 1632 1677 had a view which contrasted with hobbes in that he saw natural desires as a form of bondage that are not chosen by a person of their own free will david hume 1711 1776 claimed that desires and passions are non cognitive automatic bodily responses and he argued that reasoning is capable only of devising means to ends set by bodily desire immanuel kant 1724 1804 called any action based on desires a hypothetical imperative which means they are a command of reason applying only if one desires the goal in question kant also established a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in critique of judgment georg wilhelm friedrich hegel claimed that self consciousness is desire because desire can cause humans to become obsessed and embittered it has been called one of the causes of woe for mankind religion buddhism in buddhism craving see ta\u1e47h\u0101 is thought to be the cause of all suffering that one experiences in human existence the eradication of craving leads one to ultimate happiness or nirvana however desire for wholesome things is seen as liberating and enhancing while the stream of desire for sense pleasures must be cut eventually a practitioner on the path to liberation is encouraged by the buddha to generate desire for the fostering of skillful qualities and the abandoning of unskillful ones for an individual to effect his or her liberation the flow of sense desire must be cut completely however while training he or she must work with motivational processes based on skillfully applied desire according to the early buddhist scriptures the buddha stated that monks should generate desire for the sake of fostering skillful qualities and abandoning unskillful ones christianity within christianity desire is seen as something that can either lead a person towards god or away from him desire is not considered to be a bad thing in and of itself rather it is a powerful force within the human that once submitted to the lordship of christ can become a tool for good for advancement and for abundant living hinduism in hinduism the rig veda s creation myth nasadiya sukta states regarding the one ekam spirit in the beginning there was desire kama that was first seed of mind poets found the bond of being in non being in their heart s thought psychology neuropsychology while desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons psychologists often describe desires as ur emotions or feelings that do not quite fit the category of basic emotions for psychologists desires arise from bodily structures and functions e g the stomach needing food and the blood needing oxygen on the other hand emotions arise from a person s mental state a 2008 study by the university of michigan indicated that while humans experience desire and fear as psychological opposites they share the same brain circuit a 2008 study entitled the neural correlates of desire showed that the human brain categorizes stimuli according to its desirability by activating three different brain areas the superior orbitofrontal cortex the mid cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex in affective neuroscience desire and wanting are operationally defined as motivational salience the form of desire or wanting associated with a rewarding stimulus i e a stimulus which acts as a positive reinforcer such as palatable food an attractive mate or an addictive drug is called incentive salience and research has demonstrated that incentive salience the sensation of pleasure and positive reinforcement are all derived from neuronal activity within the reward system studies have shown that dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell and endogenous opioid signaling in the ventral pallidum are at least partially responsible for mediating an individual s desire i e incentive salience for a rewarding stimulus and the subjective perception of pleasure derived from experiencing or consuming a rewarding stimulus e g pleasure derived from eating palatable food sexual pleasure from intercourse with an attractive mate or euphoria from using an addictive drug research also shows that the orbitofrontal cortex has connections to both the opioid and dopamine systems and stimulating this cortex is associated with subjective reports of pleasure psychoanalysis austrian psychiatrist sigmund freud who is best known for his theories of the unconscious mind and the defense mechanism of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis proposed the notion of the oedipus complex which argues that desire for the mother creates neuroses in their sons freud used the greek myth of oedipus to argue that people desire incest and must repress that desire he claimed that children pass through several stages including a stage in which they fixate on the mother as a sexual object that this complex is universal has long since been disputed even if it were true that would not explain those neuroses in daughters but only in sons while it is true that sexual confusion can be aberrative in a few cases there is no credible evidence to suggest that it is a universal scenario while freud was correct in labeling the various symptoms behind most compulsions phobias and disorders he was largely incorrect in his theories regarding the etiology of what he identified french psychoanalyst and psychiatrist jacques lacan 1901 1981 argues that desire first occurs during a mirror phase of a baby s development when the baby sees an image of wholeness in a mirror which gives them a desire for that being as a person matures lacan claims that they still feel separated from themselves by language which is incomplete and so a person continually strives to become whole he uses the term jouissance to refer to the lost object or feeling of absence see manque which a person believes to be unobtainable gilles deleuze rejects the idea defended by lacan and other psychoanalysts that desire is a form of lack related to incompleteness or a lost object instead he holds that it should be understood as a positive reality in the form of an affirmative vital force marketing in the field of marketing desire is the human appetite for a given object of attention desire for a product is stimulated by advertising which attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting in store retailing merchants attempt to increase the desire of the buyer by showcasing the product attractively in the case of clothes or jewellery or for food stores by offering samples with print tv and radio advertising desire is created by giving the potential buyer a sense of lacking are you still driving that old car or by associating the product with desirable attributes either by showing a celebrity using or wearing the product or by giving the product a halo effect by showing attractive models with the product nike s just do it ads for sports shoes are appealing to consumers desires for self betterment in some cases the potential buyer already has the desire for the product before they enter the store as in the case of a decorating buff entering their favorite furniture store the role of the salespeople in these cases is simply to guide the customer towards making a choice they do not have to try to sell the general idea of making a purchase because the customer already wants the products in other cases the potential buyer does not have a desire for the product or service and so the company has to create the sense of desire an example of this situation is for life insurance most young adults are not thinking about dying so they are not naturally thinking about how they need to have accidental death insurance life insurance companies though are attempting to create a desire for life insurance with advertising that shows pictures of children and asks if anything happens to you who will pay for the children s upkeep marketing theorists call desire the third stage in the hierarchy of effects which occurs when the buyer develops a sense that if they felt the need for the type of product in question the advertised product is what would quench their desire artworks texts the theme of desire is at the core of the written fictions especially romance novels novels which are based around the theme of desire which can range from a long aching feeling to an unstoppable torrent include madame bovary by gustave flaubert love in the time of cholera by gabriel garc\u00eda m\u00e1rquez lolita by vladimir nabokov jane eyre by charlotte bront\u00eb and dracula by bram stoker bront\u00eb s characterization of jane eyre depicts her as torn by an inner conflict between reason and desire because customs and conventionalities stand in the way of her romantic desires e m forster s novels use homoerotic codes to describe same sex desire and longing close male friendships with subtle homoerotic undercurrents occur in every novel which subverts the conventional heterosexual plot of the novels in the gothic themed dracula stoker depicts the theme of desire which is coupled with fear when the character lucy is seduced by dracula she describes her sensations in the graveyard as a mixture of fear and blissful emotion poet w b yeats depicts the positive and negative aspects of desire in his poems such as the rose for the world adam s curse no second troy all things can tempt me and meditations in time of civil war some poems depict desire as a poison for the soul yeats worked through his desire for his beloved maud gonne and realized that our longing our craving our thirsting for something other than reality is what dissatisfies us in the rose for the world he admires her beauty but feels pain because he cannot be with her in the poem no second troy yeats overflows with anger and bitterness because of their unrequited love poet t s eliot dealt with the themes of desire and homoeroticism in his poetry prose and drama other poems on the theme of desire include john donne s poem to his mistress going to bed carol ann duffy s longings in warming her pearls ted hughes lovesong about the savage intensity of desire and wendy cope s humorous poem song philippe borgeaud s novels analyse how emotions such as erotic desire and seduction are connected to fear and wrath by examining cases where people are worried about issues of impurity sin and shame films just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance it is the central theme of melodrama films which are a subgenre of the drama film like drama a melodrama depends mostly on in depth character development interaction and highly emotional themes melodramatic films tend to use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience melodramatic plots often deal with crises of human emotion failed romance or friendship strained familial situations tragedy illness neuroses or emotional and physical hardship film critics sometimes use the term pejoratively to connote an unrealistic bathos filled campy tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters often including a central female character that would directly appeal to feminine audiences also called women s movies weepies tearjerkers or chick flicks melodrama is hollywood s fairly consistent way of treating desire and subject identity as can be seen in well known films such as gone with the wind in which desire is the driving force for both scarlett and the hero rhett scarlett desires love money the attention of men and the vision of being a virtuous true lady rhett butler desires to be with scarlett which builds to a burning longing that is ultimately his undoing because scarlett keeps refusing his advances when she finally confesses her secret desire rhett is worn out and his longing is spent in cathy cupitt s article on desire and vision in blade runner she argues that film as a visual narrative form plays with the voyeuristic desires of its audience focusing on the dystopian 1980s science fiction film blade runner she calls the film an object of visual desire in which it plays to an expectation of an audience s delight in visual texture with the retro fitted spectacle of the post modern city to ogle and with the

relationship also known as an on and off relationship or simply on off relationship is a form of interpersonal relationship between two people whose breakups are followed by reconciliation perpetuating a cycle relationship reconciliation is defined as the process in which partners attempt to heal the hurt or wrong that was done and move on from it to progress forward in the relationship this process of breaking up and getting back together can be short or long term these relationships differ from non cyclical relationships in that on again off again relationships are between partners that have pre existing knowledge and experiences with each other in addition to this on and off partners often report more relationship uncertainty questioning the meaning of the relationship its strength and future despite this a 2009 study published in the personal relationships journal revealed that nearly two thirds of participants have experienced being in an on again off again relationship according to professor rene dailey at the university of texas at austin there are no specific relationship dispositions that make someone more or less likely to be in an on again off again relationship dailey defines relationship disposition to be the way that individuals approach their relationship in regards to its purpose and functioning this includes attachment style destiny and growth beliefs and communal orientation in her 2020 study of on and off and non cyclical partners results did not show on and off partners to be more avoidant believe in destiny more strongly or have less communal orientation than the non cyclical couples causes a 2011 study published in the journal of social psychology revealed that lingering feelings and continued attachment were the most common reasons why partners decided to get back together furthermore reconciliation often was initiated by one person while the other partner may not have strongly wanted to get back together familiarity with the relationship may have led to the decision to get back together other common causes for renewal of these relationships include changing perceptions dissatisfaction with alternative partners missing companionship sympathy for the partner and investment those who experienced on and off patterns also tended to show strong beliefs in that love overcomes all obstacles and that there is only one true partner for that person in relationship churning in emerging adulthood on off relationships and sex with an ex the authors note that individuals going through this process often look to the positive qualities of the relationship to guide their decisions some research also suggests that breaking up can happen more frequently when it used as a tactic to attain what an individual wants and thus it creates an unhealthy cycle of conflict followed by ending the relationship and getting back together impact potential drawbacks and risks on and off partners report experiencing more negative aspects of the relationship in comparison to non cyclical partners these relationships are often strained by doubt disappointment and emotional frustration thus being in an on again off again relationship can damage one s mental health researcher kale monk an assistant professor of human development and family sciences at the university of missouri discusses how these types of relationships can have higher rates of abuse poorer communication and lower levels of commitment in a 2013 study analyzing relationship churning in relation to physical violence and verbal abuse researchers found that relationships with on and off patterns are twice as likely as couples who stably broke up or are together to report physical violence and half as likely to report verbal abuse this may arise from the instability that comes with many on and off relationships as there may be a tendency for quicker escalation and poor communication and relationship skills furthermore on and off relationships pose risks in the healing process research has shown more difficulty in partners moving on by continuing this cycle especially if partners have sex during periods of technically not being together partners s feelings of pain may also intensify with such emotionally taxing events on the other hand on and off patterns can potentially normalize relationship disruptions and reconciliations for future relationships because of this breakups may not have the same impact as they once did potential benefits despite this not all on again off again relationships are considered toxic as breaking up and reconciling can help a couple with better communication and address the issues in their relationships on and off partners have reported future relationship knowledge as being the top benefit of these types of relationships other benefits include new perspectives improving the current relationship and learning more about yourself emerging adulthood this cyclical nature of relationships has proven to be a common part of emerging adulthood of many from a developmental perspective this is in some ways expected as it is a part of exploration in young adulthood individuals attempt to learn what they want in future relationships and long term partners and in doing so this time period can be tumultuous as they are building up experience in relationships in a 2013 study analyzing relationship instability published in the national institute of health researchers reported that half of the young adults in the sample reported reconciliation from their current or most recent relationship dating and cohabiting couples in emerging adulthood showed higher frequency in reconciliation than in married couples in part due to less commitment less investment and simply the nature of the relationship less committed couples may breakup in less extreme circumstances and thus reconciliations are more likely to occur references", "Psychological abuse": "psychological abuse often known as emotional abuse or mental abuse is a form of abuse characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another person to a behavior that may result in psychological trauma including anxiety chronic depression clinical depression or post traumatic stress disorder amongst other psychological problems it is often associated with situations of power imbalance in abusive relationships and may include bullying gaslighting abuse in the workplace amongst other behaviors that may cause an individual to feel unsafe it also may be perpetrated by persons conducting torture other violence acute or prolonged human rights abuse particularly without legal redress such as detention without trial false accusations false convictions and extreme defamation such as where perpetrated by state and media general definition clinicians and researchers have offered different definitions of psychological abuse according to current research the terms psychological abuse and emotional abuse can be used interchangeably unless associated with psychological violence more specifically emotional abuse is any abuse that is emotional rather than physical it can include anything from verbal abuse and constant criticism to more subtle tactics such as intimidation manipulation and refusal to ever be pleased this abuse occurs when someone uses words or actions to try and control the other person to keep someone afraid or isolated or try to break someone s self esteem emotional abuse can take several forms three general patterns of abusive behavior include aggressing denying and minimizing withholding is another form of denying withholding includes refusing to listen to communicate and emotionally withdrawing as punishment even though there is no established definition for emotional abuse emotional abuse can possess a definition beyond verbal and psychological abuse blaming shaming and name calling are a few verbally abusive behaviors that can affect a victim emotionally the victim s self worth and emotional well being are altered and even diminished by the verbal abuse resulting in an emotionally abused victim the victim may experience severe psychological effects this would involve the tactics of brainwashing which can fall under psychological abuse as well but emotional abuse consists of the manipulation of the victim s emotions the victim may feel their emotions are being affected by the abuser to such an extent that the victim may no longer recognize their own feelings regarding the issues the abuser is trying to control the result is the victim s self concept and independence are systematically taken away the u s department of justice defines emotionally abusive traits as causing fear by intimidation threatening physical harm to self partner children or partner s family or friends destruction of pets and property and forcing isolation from family friends or school or work more subtle emotionally abusive behaviors include insults putdowns arbitrary and unpredictable behavior and gaslighting e g the denial that previous abusive incidents occurred modern technology has led to new forms of abuse by text messaging and online cyber bullying in 1996 health canada argued that emotional abuse is based on power and control and defines emotional abuse as including rejecting degrading terrorizing isolating corrupting exploiting and denying emotional responsiveness as characteristic of emotional abuse several studies have argued that an isolated incident of verbal aggression dominant conduct or jealous behaviors does not constitute the term psychological abuse rather it is defined by a pattern of such behaviors unlike physical and sexual maltreatment where only one incident is necessary to label it as abuse tomison and tucci write emotional abuse is characterized by a climate or pattern of behavior s occurring over time thus sustained and repetitive are the crucial components of any definition of emotional abuse andrew vachss an author attorney and former sex crimes investigator defines emotional abuse as the systematic diminishment of another it may be intentional or subconscious or both but it is always a course of conduct not a single event prevalence intimate relationships when discussing the different types of psychological abuse in terms of domestically violent relationships it is important to recognize the 4 different types denigrating damage to partner s self image or esteem passive aggressive withholding of emotional support threatening behavior and restricting personal territory and freedom denigrating damage refers to an individual using verbal aggression like yelling towards their partner that is delivered as profane and derogatory passive aggressive withholding of emotional support refers to an individual intentionally avoiding and withdrawing themselves from their partner in an attempt to be neglectful and emotionally abandoning threatening behavior refers to an individual making verbal threats towards their partner that could imply eliciting physical harm threats of divorce lying and threats of reckless behavior that could put their safety at risk restricting personal territory and freedom refers to the isolation of social support from family and friends this could include taking away partner s autonomy and having a lack of personal boundaries it has been reported that at least 80 of women who have entered the criminal justice system due to partner violence have also experienced psychological abuse from their partner this partner violence is also known as domestic abuse domestic abuse defined as chronic mistreatment in marriage families dating and other intimate relationships can include emotionally abusive behavior although psychological abuse does not always lead to physical abuse physical abuse in domestic relationships is nearly always preceded and accompanied by psychological abuse murphy and o leary reported that psychological aggression is the most reliable predictor of later physical aggression a 2012 review by capaldi et al which evaluated risk factors for intimate partner violence ipv noted that psychological abuse has been shown to be both associated with and common in ipv high levels of verbal aggression and relationship conflict practically akin to psychological aggression strongly predicted ipv male jealousy in particular was associated with female injuries from ipv attempts to define and describe violence and abuse in hetero normative intimate relationships can become contentious as different studies present different conclusions about whether men or women are the primary instigators for instance a 2005 study by hamel reports that men and women physically and emotionally abuse each other at equal rates basile found that psychological aggression was effectively bidirectional in cases where heterosexual and homosexual couples went to court for domestic disturbances a 2007 study of spanish college students aged 18 27 found that psychological aggression as measured by the conflict tactics scale is so pervasive in dating relationships that it can be regarded as a normalized element of dating and that women are substantially more likely to exhibit psychological aggression similar findings have been reported in other studies strauss et al found that female intimate partners in heterosexual relationships were more likely than males to use psychological aggression including threats to hit or throw an object a study of young adults by giordano et al found that females in intimate heterosexual relationships were more likely than males to threaten to use a knife or gun against their partner while studies allege that women use violence in intimate relationships as often or more often than men women s violence is typically self defensive rather than aggressive in 1996 the national clearinghouse on family violence for health canada reported that 39 of married women or common law wives suffered emotional abuse by husbands partners and a 1995 survey of women 15 and over 36 43 reported emotional abuse during childhood or adolescence and 39 experienced emotional abuse in marriage dating this report does not address boys or men suffering emotional abuse from families or intimate partners a bbc radio documentary on domestic abuse including emotional maltreatment reports that 20 of men and 30 of women have been abused by a spouse or other intimate partner child emotional abuse psychological abuse of a child is commonly defined as a pattern of behavior by parents or caregivers that can seriously interfere with a child s cognitive emotional psychological or social development according to the dsm 5 child psychological abuse is defined as verbal or symbolic acts given by parent or caregiver which can result in significant psychological harm examples are yelling comparing to others name calling blaming gaslighting manipulating and normalizing abuse due to the status of being underage some parents may emotionally and psychologically harm their children because of stress poor parenting skills social isolation and lack of available resources or inappropriate expectations of their children straus and field report that psychological aggression is a pervasive trait of american families verbal attacks on children like physical attacks are so prevalent as to be just about universal a 2008 study by english et al found that fathers and mothers were equally likely to be verbally aggressive towards their children elder emotional abuse choi and mayer performed a study on elder abuse causing harm or distress to an older person with results showing that 10 5 of the participants were victims of emotional psychological abuse which was most often perpetrated by a son or other relative of the victim of 1288 cases in 2002 2004 1201 individuals 42 couples and 45 groups were found to have been abused of these 70 were female psychological abuse 59 and material financial abuse 42 were the most frequently identified types of abuse one study found that the overall prevalence rate of abused elderly in hong kong was 21 4 out of this percentage 20 8 reported being verbally abused workplace rates of reported emotional abuse in the workplace vary with studies showing 10 24 and 36 of respondents indicating persistent and substantial emotional abuse from coworkers keashly and jagatic found that males and females commit emotionally abusive behaviors in the workplace at roughly similar rates in a web based survey namie found that women were more likely to engage in workplace bullying such as name calling and that the average length of abuse was 16 5 months pai and lee found that the incidence of workplace violence typically occurs more often in younger workers younger age may be a reflection of lack of job experience resulting in an inability to identify or prevent potentially abusive situations another finding showed that lower education is a risk factor for violence this study also reports that 51 4 of the workers surveyed have already experienced verbal abuse and 29 8 of them have encountered workplace bullying and mobbing characteristics of abusers in their review of data from the dunedin multidisciplinary health and development study a longitudinal birth cohort study moffitt et al report that while men exhibit more aggression overall sex is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression including psychological aggression the darvo study found that no matter what gender a person is aggressive people share a cluster of traits including high rates of suspicion and jealousy sudden and drastic mood swings poor self control and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression moffitt et al also argue that antisocial men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression one against strangers the other against intimate female partners while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners or their own children abusers may aim to avoid household chores or exercise total control of family finances abusers can be very manipulative often recruiting friends law officers and court officials and even the victim s family to their side while shifting blame to the victim a victim may internalize the abuse and may form future relationships with abusers effects abuse of intimate partners most victims of psychological abuse within intimate relationships often experience changes to their psyche and actions this varies throughout the various types and lengths of emotional abuse long term emotional abuse has long term debilitating effects on a person s sense of self and integrity often research shows that emotional abuse is a precursor to physical abuse when three particular forms of emotional abuse are present in the relationship threats restriction of the abused party and damage to the victim s property psychological abuse is often not recognized by survivors of domestic violence as abuse a study of college students by goldsmith and freyd report that many who have experienced emotional abuse do not characterize the mistreatment as abusive additionally goldsmith and freyd show that these people also tend to exhibit higher than average rates of alexithymia difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions this is often the case when referring to victims of abuse within intimate relationships as non recognition of the actions as abuse may be a coping or defense mechanism in order to either seek to master minimize or tolerate stress or conflict marital or relationship dissatisfaction can be caused by psychological abuse or aggression in a 2007 study laurent et al report that psychological aggression in young couples is associated with decreased satisfaction for both partners psychological aggression may serve as an impediment to couples development because it reflects less mature coercive tactics and an inability to balance self other needs effectively in a 2008 study on relationship dissatisfaction in adolescents walsh and shulman explain the more psychologically aggressive females were the less satisfied were both partners the unique importance of males behavior was found in the form of withdrawal a less mature conflict negotiation strategy males withdrawal during joint discussions predicted increased satisfaction there are many different responses to psychological abuse jacobson et al found that women report markedly higher rates of fear during marital conflicts however a rejoinder argued that jacobson s results were invalid due to men and women s drastically differing interpretations of questionnaires coker et al found that the effects of mental abuse were similar whether the victim was male or female a 1998 study of male college students by simonelli ingram found that men who were emotionally abused by their female partners exhibited higher rates of chronic depression than the general population pimlott kubiak and cortina found that severity and duration of abuse were the only accurate predictors of after effects of abuse sex of perpetrator or victim were not reliable predictors abuse of children the effects of psychological abuse on children can involve a variety of mental health concerns such as post traumatic stress disorder major depressive disorder personality disorders low self esteem aggression anxiety and emotional unresponsiveness these effects can be exemplified by the constant criticism regular living with threats or being rejected that can be exemplified by withholding love and support as well as not having any guidance from the guardians of the children english et al report that children specifically whose families are characterized by interpersonal violence including psychological aggression and verbal aggression may exhibit these disorders additionally english et al report that the impact of emotional abuse did not differ significantly from that of physical abuse johnson et al report that in a survey of female patients 24 suffered emotional abuse and that this group experienced higher rates of gynecological problems in their study of men emotionally abused by a wife partner or parent hines and malley morrison report that victims exhibit high rates of post traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction including alcoholism glaser reports an infant who is severely deprived of basic emotional nurturance even though physically well cared for can fail to thrive and can eventually die babies with less severe emotional deprivation can grow into anxious and insecure children who are slow to develop and who have low self esteem glaser also informs that the abuse impacts the child in a number of ways especially on their behavior including insecurity poor self esteem destructive behavior angry acts such as fire setting and animal cruelty withdrawal poor development of basic skills alcohol or drug abuse suicide difficulty forming relationships and unstable job histories oberlander et al performed a study which discovered that among the youth those with a history of maltreatment showed that emotional distress is a predictor of early initiation of sexual intercourse oberlander et al state a childhood history of maltreatment including psychological abuse and neglect has been identified as a risk factor for early initiation of sexual intercourse in families where child maltreatment had occurred children were more likely to experience heightened emotional distress and subsequently to engage in sexual intercourse by age 14 it is possible that maltreated youth feel disconnected from families that did not protect them and subsequently seek sexual relationships to gain support seek companionship or enhance their standing with peers it is apparent that psychological abuse sustained during childhood is a predictor of the onset of sexual conduct occurring earlier in life as opposed to later abuse in the workplace psychological abuse has been found present within the workplace as evidenced by previous research namie s study of workplace emotional abuse found that 31 of women and 21 of men who reported workplace emotional abuse exhibited three key symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder hypervigilance intrusive imagery and avoidance behaviors the most common psychological professional financial and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation are as follows psychological stress and health impairment loss of motivation decreased work or school performance as a result of stressful conditions increased absenteeism in fear of harassment repetition having to drop courses change academic plans or leave school loss of tuition in fear of harassment repetition or as a result of stress being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip loss of trust in environments similar to where the harassment occurred loss of trust in the types of people that occupy similar positions as the harasser or their colleagues especially in cases where they are not supportive difficulties or stress on peer relationships or relationships with colleagues effects on sexual life and relationships can put extreme stress upon relationships with significant others sometimes resulting in divorce weakening of support network or being ostracized from professional or academic circles friends colleagues or family may distance themselves from the victim or shun him or her altogether depression anxiety or panic attacks sleeplessness or nightmares difficulty concentrating headaches fatigue eating disorders weight loss or gain alcoholism and feeling powerless or out of control abuse of the elderly elderly who have suffered psychological abuse have been found to experience similar outcomes as other population groups such as depression anxiety feelings of isolation and neglect and powerlessness one study examined 355 chinese elderly participants 60 and older and found that 75 of reported abusers were grown up children of the elderly within this study these individuals suffered outcomes from the abuse specifically verbal abuse which contributed to their psychological distress prevention in intimate relationships recognition of abuse is the first step to prevention it is often difficult for abuse victims to acknowledge their situation and to seek help for those who do seek help research has shown that people who participate in an intimate partner violence prevention program report less psychological aggression toward their targets of psychological abuse and reported victimization from psychological abuse decreased over time for the treatment group there are non profit organizations that provide support and prevention services such as the national domestic violence hotline the salvation army and benefits gov in the family child abuse in the sole form of emotional psychological maltreatment is often the most difficult to identify and prevent as government organizations such as child protective services in the us is often the only method of intervention and the institute must have demonstrable evidence that harm to a child has been done before they can intervene due to this a lot of victims may stay in the care of their abuser since emotional abuse doesn t result in physical evidence such as bruising or malnutrition it can be very hard to diagnose some researchers have however begun to develop methods to diagnose and treat such abuse including the ability to identify risk factors provide resources to victims and their families and ask appropriate questions to help identify the abuse in the workplace the majority of companies within the united states provide access to a human resources department in which to report cases of psychological emotional abuse also many managers are required to participate in conflict management programs in order to ensure the workplace maintains an open and respectful atmosphere with tolerance for diversity and where the existence of interpersonal frustration and friction is accepted but also properly managed organizations must adopt zero tolerance policies for professional verbal abuse education and coaching are needed to help employees to improve their skills when responding to professional to professional verbal abuse popular perceptions several studies found double standards in how people tend to view emotional abuse by men versus emotional abuse by women follingstad et al found that when rating hypothetical vignettes of psychological abuse in marriages professional psychologists tend to rate male abuse of females as more serious than identical scenarios describing female abuse of males the stereotypical association between physical aggression and males appears to extend to an association of psychological abuse and males 446 similarly sorenson and taylor randomly surveyed a group of los angeles california residents for their opinions of hypothetical vignettes of abuse in heterosexual relationships their study found that abuse committed by women including emotional and psychological abuse such as controlling or humiliating behavior was typically viewed as less serious or detrimental than identical abuse committed by men additionally sorenson and taylor found that respondents had a broader range of opinions about female perpetrators representing a lack of clearly defined mores when compared to responses about male perpetrators when considering the emotional state of psychological abusers psychologists have focused on aggression as a contributing factor while it is typical for people to consider males to be the more aggressive of the two sexes researchers have studied female aggression to help understand psychological abuse patterns in situations involving female abusers according to walsh and shluman the higher rates of female initiated aggression including psychological aggression may result in part from adolescents attitudes about the unacceptability of male aggression and the relatively less negative attitudes toward female aggression this concept that females are raised with fewer restrictions on aggressive behaviors possibly due to the anxiety over aggression being focused on males is a possible explanation for women who utilize aggression when being mentally abusive some researchers have become interested in discovering exactly why women are usually not considered to be abusive hamel s 2007 study found that a prevailing patriarchal conception of intimate partner violence led to a systematic reluctance to study women who psychologically and physically abuse their male partners these findings state that existing cultural norms show males as more dominant and are therefore more likely to begin abusing their significant partners dutton found that men who are emotionally or physically abused often encounter victim blaming that erroneously presumes the man either provoked or deserved the mistreatment by their female partners similarly domestic violence victims will often blame their own behavior rather than the violent actions of the abuser victims may try continually to alter their behavior and circumstances in order to please their abuser often this results in further dependence of the individual on their abuser as they may often change certain aspects of their lives that limit their resources a 2002 study concluded that emotional abusers frequently aim to exercise total control of different aspects of family life this behavior is only supported when the victim of the abuse aims to please their abuser many abusers are able to control their victims in a manipulative manner utilizing methods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the abuser rather than to force them to do something they do not wish to do simon argues that because aggression in abusive relationships can be carried out subtly and covertly through various manipulation and control tactics victims often do not perceive the true nature of the relationship until conditions worsen considerably cultural causes a researcher in 1988 said that wife abuse stems from normal psychological and behavioral patterns of most men feminists seek to understand why men in general use physical force against their partners and what functions this serves for a society in a given historical context dobash and dobash 1979 said that men who assault their wives are living up to cultural prescriptions that are cherished in western society aggressiveness male dominance and female subordination and they are using physical force as a means to enforce that dominance while walker claims that men exhibit a socialized androcentric need for power while some women are aggressive and dominating to male partners a 2003 report concluded that the majority of abuse in heterosexual partnerships at about 80 in the us is perpetrated by men critics stress that this department of justice study examines crime figures and does not specifically address domestic abuse figures while the categories of crime and domestic abuse may cross over many instances of domestic abuse are either not regarded as crimes or reported to police critics thus argue that it is inaccurate to regard the doj study as a comprehensive statement on domestic abuse a 2002 study reports that ten percent of violence in the uk overall is by females against males however more recent data specifically regarding domestic abuse including emotional abuse report that 3 in 10 women and 1 in 5 men have experienced domestic abuse one source said that legal systems have in the past endorsed these traditions of male domination and it is only in recent years that abusers have begun to be punished for their behavior in 1879 a harvard university law scholar wrote the cases in the american courts are uniform against the right of the husband to use any chastisement moderate or otherwise toward the wife for any purpose while recognizing that researchers have done valuable work and highlighted neglected topics critics suggest that the male cultural domination hypothesis for abuse is untenable as a generalized explanation for numerous reasons a 1989 study concluded that many variables racial ethnic cultural and subcultural nationality religion family dynamics and mental illness make it very difficult or impossible to define male and female roles in any meaningful way that apply to the entire population a 1995 study concluded that disagreements about power sharing in relationships are more strongly associated with abuse than are imbalances of power peer reviewed studies have produced inconsistent results when directly examining patriarchal beliefs and wife abuse yllo and straus 1990 said that low status women in the united states suffered higher rates of spousal abuse however a rejoinder argued that yllo and straus s interpretive conclusions were confusing and contradictory smith 1990 estimated that patriarchal beliefs were a causative factor for only 20 of wife abuse campbell 1993 writes that there is not a simple linear correlation between female status and rates of wife assault 19 other studies had similar findings additionally a 1994 study of hispanic americans revealed that traditionalist men exhibited lower rates of abuse towards women studies from the 1980s showed that treatment programs based on the patriarchal privilege model are flawed due to a weak connection between abusiveness and one s cultural or social attitudes a 1992 study challenge the concept that male abuse or control of women is culturally sanctioned and concluded that abusive men are widely viewed as unsuitable partners for dating or marriage a 1988 study concluded that a minority of abusive men qualify as pervasively misogynistic a 1986 study concluded that the majority of men who commit spousal abuse agree that their behavior was inappropriate a 1970 study concluded that a minority of men approve of spousal abuse under even limited circumstances studies from the 1970 and 1980s concluded that the majority of men are non abusive towards girlfriends or wives for the duration of relationships contrary to predictions that aggression or abuse towards women is an innate element of masculine culture in 1994 a researcher said that the numerous studies establishing that heterosexual and gay male relationships have lower rates of abuse than lesbian relationships and the fact that women who have been involved with both men and women were more likely to have been abused by a woman are difficult to explain in terms of male domination additionally dutton said that patriarchy must interact with psychological variables in order to account for the great variation in power violence data it is suggested that some forms of psychopathology lead to some men adopting patriarchal ideology to justify and rationalize their own pathology a 2010 study said that fundamentalist views of religions tend to reinforce emotional abuse and that gender inequity is usually translated into a power imbalance with women being more vulnerable this vulnerability is more precarious in traditional patriarchal societies in the book of genesis god specifically punishes women after adam and eve disobey him in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee god also condemns adam to a lifetime of work for the sin of listening to his wife some studies say that fundamentalist religious prohibitions against divorce may make it more difficult for religious men or women to leave an abusive marriage a 1985 survey of protestant clergy in the united states by jim m alsdurf found that 21 of them agreed that no amount of abuse would justify a woman s leaving her husband ever and 26 agreed with the statement that a wife should submit to her husband and trust that god would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it a 2016 report by the muslim women s network uk cited several barriers for muslim women in abusive marriages who seek divorce through sharia council services these barriers include selectively quoting religious text to discourage divorce blaming the woman for the failed marriage placing greater weight on the husband s testimony requiring the woman to present two male witnesses and pressuring women into mediation or reconciliation rather than granting a divorce even when domestic violence is present in today s world various forms of abuse are increasingly being recognized in all parts of the world the level of awareness regarding abuse varies from one country to another both victims and perpetrators around the world are being acknowledged more readily

honeymoon phase is a state of mind experienced at the beginning of sexual and romantic relationships typically involving heightened emotional and sexual feelings and excitement nre begins with the earliest attractions may grow into full force when mutuality is established and can fade over months or years the term indicates contrast to those feelings aroused in an old or ongoing relationship the term originated in the usenet postings of zhahai stewart in the 1980s and was more widely presented in 1993 this concept is similar to that of limerence which was first defined in 1979 but differs in that limerence can also be experienced absent a relationship while the dynamics described by nre apply to all relationships the term is particularly prevalent in the polyamorous community as people with multiple concurrent intimate relationships experience new relationship energy alongside more settled ongoing relationships adjusting to and compensating for the contrast in affect and excitement between the new and old relationships is considered an important factor in successfully balancing those relationships describing the process in a positive way can help old partners deal with feelings of jealousy towards the new partner as well as helping the person with a new partner be more understanding and conscious of maintaining their existing relationships new relationship energy is generally considered desirable perhaps nearly indispensable in forming deep emotional bonds but it can also temporarily distort perceptions and judgments and this must be taken into account these distortions of perception do not automatically imply that the attraction is unreal or will not last indeed most lasting romantic bonds do begin with nre although this does not mean that most relationships that begin with nre would lead to lasting romantic bonds because of the complications that can come with the end of nre only that the magnitude of these positive feelings is greater than it is likely to be later and some potential interpersonal problems may seem smaller than they will later become caution rather than avoidance or suppression is usually suggested in dealing with nre a less common variant is new relationship chemistry which is conceptually similar to nre except with emphasis explicitly limited to the brain chemistry involved in creating the euphoric feelings rather than actions and rationalized feelings involved with nre see also infatuation intense but shallow attraction limerence romantic love lovesickness or love madness passionate and companionate love two

national geographic magazine feb 2006 love the chemical reaction", "Jealousy": "jealousy generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity fear and concern over a relative lack of possessions or safety jealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as anger resentment inadequacy helplessness or disgust in its original meaning jealousy is distinct from envy though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the english language with jealousy now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone these two emotions are often confused with each other since they tend to appear in the same situation jealousy is a typical experience in human relationships and it has been observed in infants as young as five months some researchers claim that jealousy is seen in all cultures and is a universal trait however others claim jealousy is a culture specific emotion jealousy can either be suspicious or reactive and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience psychologists have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy sociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy biologists have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy throughout history artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in paintings films songs plays poems and books and theologians have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths etymology the word stems from the french jalousie formed from jaloux jealous and further from low latin zelosus full of zeal in turn from the greek word \u03b6\u1fc6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 z\u0113los sometimes jealousy but more often in a positive sense emulation ardour zeal with a root connoting to boil ferment or yeast the biblical language zeal would be known as tolerating no unfaithfulness while in middle english zealous is good one origin word gelus meant possessive and suspicious the word then turned into jelus since william shakespeare s use of terms like green eyed monster the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy from which the expression green with envy is derived theories scientific examples people do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior they instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy scientists instead define it in their own words as illustrated by the following examples romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts feelings and actions which follow threats to self esteem and or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of potential attraction between one s partner and a perhaps imaginary rival jealousy then is any aversive reaction that occurs as the result of a partner s extradyadic relationship that is considered likely to occur jealousy is conceptualized as a cognitive emotional and behavioral response to a relationship threat in the case of sexual jealousy this threat emanates from knowing or suspecting that one s partner has had or desires to have sexual activity with a third party in the case of emotional jealousy an individual feels threatened by her or his partner s emotional involvement with and or love for a third party jealousy is defined as a defensive reaction to a perceived threat to a valued relationship arising from a situation in which the partner s involvement with an activity and or another person is contrary to the jealous person s definition of their relationship jealousy is triggered by the threat of separation from or loss of a romantic partner when that threat is attributed to the possibility of the partner s romantic interest in another person these definitions of jealousy share two basic themes first all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual a partner and a perception of a third party or rival second all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people or a dyad jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships these themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies comparison with envy popular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for envy many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings in fact the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history the terms are used indiscriminately in such popular feel good books as nancy friday s jealousy where the expression jealousy applies to a broad range of passions from envy to lust and greed while this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems margot grzywacz s fascinating etymological survey of the word in romance and germanic languages asserts indeed that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an unambiguous term classical latin used invidia without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy it was not until the postclassical era that latin borrowed the late and poetic greek word zelotypia and the associated adjective zelosus it is from this adjective that are derived french jaloux proven\u00e7al gelos italian geloso spanish celoso and portuguese cioso perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time a person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival in fact one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy a jealous person may envy the affection that their partner gives to a rival affection the jealous person feels entitled to themselves people often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy for example philosopher john rawls distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has and envy the wish to get what one does not have thus a child is jealous of her parents attention to a sibling but envious of her friend s new bicycle psychologists laura guerrero and peter andersen have proposed the same distinction they claim the jealous person perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner whereas the envious person does not possess a valued commodity but wishes to possess it gerrod parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy the common experience of jealousy for many people may involve fear of loss suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal low self esteem and sadness over perceived loss uncertainty and loneliness fear of losing an important person to another distrust the experience of envy involves feelings of inferiority longing resentment of circumstances ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings motivation to improve desire to possess the attractive rival s qualities disapproval of feelings sadness towards other s accomplishments parrott acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy still the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science in psychology jealousy involves an entire emotional episode including a complex narrative this includes the circumstances that lead up to jealousy jealousy itself as emotion any attempt at self regulation subsequent actions and events and ultimately the resolution of the episode the narrative can originate from experienced facts thoughts perceptions memories but also imagination guesses and assumptions the more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin by contrast jealousy can be a cognitively impenetrable state where education and rational belief matter very little one possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in evolutionary psychology is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes it is a biologically based emotion selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one s own offspring a jealous behavior in women is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else s offspring there are additionally cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy according to one the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination imagination is strongly affected by a person s cultural milieu the pattern of reasoning the way one perceives situations depends strongly on cultural context it has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one s needs not being met be those needs for attachment attention reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship while mainstream psychology considers sexual arousal through jealousy a paraphilia some authors on sexuality have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on sexual function and sexual satisfaction studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex jealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions one such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others jealousy is linked to aggression and low self esteem research by sybil hart phd at texas tech university indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll this research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born creating the foundation for sibling rivalry in addition to traditional jealousy comes obsessive jealousy which can be a form of obsessive compulsive disorder this jealousy is characterized by obsessional jealousy and thoughts of the partner in sociology anthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures cultural learning can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time for example attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the united states people in the united states adopted much more negative views about jealousy as men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy romantic jealousy romantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest it is defined as a complex of thoughts feelings and actions that follow threats to self esteem and or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one s partner and a perhaps imaginary rival different from sexual jealousy romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship rather than sexual interest in another person factors such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner sexual exclusivity and having put relatively more effort into the relationship are positively correlated to relationship jealousy in both genders communicative responses as romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components i e thoughts feelings and actions one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship i e reducing uncertainty maintaining or repairing relationship and restoring self esteem if done properly communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy there are two subsets of communicative responses interactive responses and general behavior responses interactive responses is face to face and partner directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness avoidance denial low threat and low directness example becoming silent pretending nothing is wrong integrative communication low threat and high directness example explaining feelings calmly questioning partner active distancing medium threat and medium directness example decreasing affection negative affect expression medium threat and medium directness example venting frustration crying or sulking distributive communication high threat and high directness example acting rude making hurtful or abrasive comments violent communication threats high threat and high directness example using physical force guerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses the five sub types differ in whether a response is 1 directed at partner or rival s 2 directed at discovery or repair and 3 positively or negatively valenced surveillance restriction rival targeted discovery oriented commonly negatively valenced example observing rival trying to restrict contact with partner rival contacts rival targeted discovery oriented repair oriented commonly negatively valenced example confronting rival manipulation attempts partner targeted repair oriented negatively valenced example tricking partner to test loyalty trying to make partner feel guilty compensatory restoration partner targeted repair oriented commonly positively valenced example sending flowers to partner violent behavior negatively valenced example slamming doors while some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive e g distributive communication and active distancing some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way integrative communication compensatory restoration and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes one factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors researchers also believe that when jealousy is experienced it can be caused by differences in understanding the commitment level of the couple rather than directly being caused by biology alone the research identified that if a person valued long term relationships more than being sexually exclusive those individuals were more likely to demonstrate jealousy over emotional rather than physical infidelity through a study conducted in three spanish speaking countries it was determined that facebook jealousy also exists this facebook jealousy ultimately leads to increased relationship jealousy and study participants also displayed decreased self esteem as a result of the facebook jealousy sexual jealousy sexual jealousy may be triggered when a person s partner displays sexual interest in another person the feeling of jealousy may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of infidelity fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative it may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners it seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner s phase in her menstrual cycle in the period around and shortly before ovulation males are found to display more mate retention tactics which are linked to jealousy furthermore a male is more likely to employ mate retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males which is more likely to occur in the pre ovulation phase contemporary views on gender based differences according to rebecca l ammon in the osprey journal of ideas and inquiry at unf digital commons 2004 the parental investment model based on parental investment theory posits that more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy in addition more women over men consider emotional infidelity fear of abandonment as more distressing than sexual infidelity according to the attachment theory sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one s level of distress these findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected the attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants attachment patterns are the basis for self report measures of adult attachment although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships as a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful moreover research shows that audit attachment styles strongly conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment in 1906 the american journal of psychology had reported that the weight of quotable male authority is to the effect that women are more susceptible to jealousy this claim was accompanied in the journal by a quote from confucius the five worst maladies that afflict the female mind are indocility discontent slander jealousy and silliness emotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males the emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy there are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships for example due to paternity uncertainty in males jealousy increases in males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional according to research more women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw i e another female than by sexual infidelity a large amount of data supports this notion however one must consider for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve the reproductive role however research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity despite this fact anger surfaces when both parties involved are responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior sexual conduct is not exempt some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior however hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation no evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples the jealousy specific innate model jsim proved to not be innate but may be sensitive to situational factors as a result it may only activate at stages for example it was predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases a second possibility that the jsim effect is not innate but is cultural differences have been highlighted in socio economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals moreover individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional infidelity jealousy is composed of lower level emotional states e g anger and hurt which may be triggered by a variety of events not by differences in individuals life stage although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships early family environment is recently being examined as we age research on self esteem and attachment theory suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals especially in an interpersonal relationship in animals a study by researchers at the university of california san diego replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines they reported in a paper published in plos one in 2014 that a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog like toys compared to when their human companions paid attention to non social objects in addition jealousy has been speculated to be a potential factor in incidences of aggression or emotional tension in dogs mellissa starling an animal behavior consultant of the university of sydney noted that dogs are social animals and they obey a group hierarchy changes in the home like the arrival of a baby can prompt a family pet to behave differently to what one might expect applications in fiction film and art artistic depictions of jealousy occur in fiction films and other art forms such as painting and sculpture jealousy is a common theme in literature art theatre and film often it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love rather than a destructive obsession a study done by ferris smith greenberg and smith looked into the way people saw dating and romantic relationships based on how many reality dating shows they watched people who spent a large amount of time watching these reality dating shows endorsed or supported the dating attitudes that would be shown on the show while the other people who do not spend time watching reality dating shows did not mirror the same ideas this means if someone watches a reality dating show that displays men and women reacting violently or aggressively towards their partner due to jealousy they can mirror that this is reflected in romantic movies as well jessica r frampton conducted a study looking into romantic jealousy in movies the study found that there were 230 instances of romantic jealousy were identified in the 51 top grossing romantic comedies from 2002 2014 some of the films did not display romantic jealousy however some featured many examples of romantic jealousy this was due to the fact that some of the top grossing movies did not contain a rival or romantic competition while others such as forgetting sarah marshall was said to contain 19 instances of romantic jealousy out of the 230 instances 58 were reactive jealousy while 31 showed possessive jealousy the last 11 displayed anxious jealousy it was seen the least in all 230 cases out of the 361 reactions to the jealousy found 53 were found to be destructive responses only 19 of responses were constructive while 10 showed avoidant responses the last 18 were considered rival focused responses which lead to the finding that there was a higher than expected number of rival focused responses to possessive jealousy in religion jealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues concepts of divine jealousy and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy cross culture a study was done in order to cross examine jealousy among four different cultures ireland thailand india and the united states these cultures were chosen to demonstrate differences in expression across cultures the study posits that male dominant cultures are more likely to express and reveal jealousy the survey found that thais are less likely to express jealousy than the other three cultures this is because the men in these cultures are rewarded in a way for showing jealousy due to the fact that some women interpret it as love this can also be seen when watching romantic comedies when males show they are jealous of a rival or emotionally jealous women perceive it as men

emotional relationship between two people who may have casual sex or a near sexual relationship while staying loyal to each other without necessarily demanding or expecting the additional commitments of a more formal romantic relationship motives for casual relationships vary there are significant gender and cultural differences in acceptance of and breadth of casual relationships as well as in regrets about action inaction in those relationships casual dating may or may not entail partner exclusivity in each case the relationship s dominance in the lives of those involved is being voluntarily limited and there is usually a sense that the relationship is intended to endure only so long as both parties wish it to casual relationships sometimes include mutual support affection and enjoyment which underpin other forms of loving relationship a casual relationship is sometimes referred to as a no strings attached relationship as a situationship or as a fling college students a no strings attached relationship is most commonly found in young adults such as college students the shift from childhood to adulthood brings on much exploration in different fields one of these fields include relationships and sexual activity grello et al s study suggests that in most cases students who lost their virginity in high school did so in a romantic relationship after experiencing sexual intercourse many college students go on to have casual sex with either friends or peers they have been recently or newly acquainted with a casual relationship unlike a romantic relationship is difficult to ascribe norms scripts and expectations to rebecca plante an associate professor at ithaca college who has specialized in research on casual relationships says that this type of relationship can be beneficial saying that casual relationships can establish a healthy outlet for sexual needs and desires types of college aged lovers j a lee defined two main types of lovers for college aged young adults eros lovers who are passionate lovers and ludas or ludic lovers which are game playing lovers eros lovers are lovers that immediately form a close connection they fall in love with the physical appearance of another before considering other characteristics of the person this type of lover also commits to casual sex relationships because physical appearance is the main reason for their attraction it is difficult for a genuine romantic relationship to form ludic lovers look for the feeling of a conquest and typically enter a relationship or hook up with very little or no intentions of commitment in most cases they will have more than one sexually active partner at a given time they also find it difficult to consider a serious relationship negotiation between participants many casual relationships establish guidelines or a set of rules the two participants in the relationship will reach an agreement about what each expects from the relationship another major concern is that one of the partners will develop romantic feelings for the other communication between the two partners is essential to making this type of relationship work and because the partners in the casual relationship are often friends beforehand talking to one another is a much simpler task relationship maintenance and student concerns casual relationships being a mix between a friendship and a non romantic sexual relationship result in the partners facing many challenges in maintaining a working relationship based on the exchange theory hughes witnessed an individual dependency on either partner as the exchange of resources knowledge rewards and costs of items becomes more and more prominent the partners may become dependent on advice the other partner gives or the company they receive when being around one another this may be a one way street and one partner may not feel this way any partner that is not fully dependent upon the other typically controls the casual relationship the dependent partner is more submissive to their dominant partner as they do not want the relationship to end this allows the less dependent partner to be able to fix and maintain the relationship the way he she wants it to be they normally control when they meet up when they have sex and when they do things together disclosure of casual relationship to peers hughes s study also revealed the four main categories of why partners participating in a casual relationship did not feel the need to tell their same sex friends about the relationship the first category was that the partners did not feel that their same sex friends needed to know this information the second category consisted of people wanting to keep the casual relationship a secret and did not want their same sex friends to know the feeling of embarrassment was the third category many students said that they would feel ashamed or did not want to be judged by their same sex friends the final category is students who did not want to tell their same sex friends because they would show disapproval of the relationship motivations hughes s study suggests that there were five main motivations to why college students wanted to be in a casual relationship the five main motivators are relationship avoidance students that liked multiple partners at once and wanted to avoid being tied down to one person sexual activity students find each other attractive and want to hook up relationship simplicity students get the benefits of a relationship without all the drama emotional connection students miss the intimacy they used to have with ex relationships and want to experience it again with no strings attached always wanted a casual relationship two students that are single and want to take advantage of it together gender participation a traditional stereotype of heterosexual casual relationships in college is that the men initiate the sexual activity another stereotype is that men are more sexually active and women link sex with romance this is not true all the time especially in college students a study conducted by paul and her team suggests that when it comes to gender participation there are just as many women initiating these relationships pressure from friends and other social means may persuade college students to participate in a casual relationship or hook up regardless of their gender many casual dating sites have an unbalanced gender ratio as they have much more men than women some of these sites are animating their male users to keep them interested or to lure them into paid subscriptions usually these animated casual dating sites are stating this directly in their terms of service as they could be sued otherwise for fraud as most users do not read terms of service when they register on a new website the animation stays hidden for most users environmental factors alcohol consumption and parties often take place on college and university campuses promiscuity is also prevalent being placed in an environment of sexually active students can put pressure on other students to consume alcohol become sexually active and engage in casual dating colleges and universities known for a larger alcohol consumption by their students seem to also have a larger number of students participating in casual relationships researchers have struggled with the idea that the perceived disinhibitory function leads to the reason for increased sexual activity casual sex casual sex are certain types of sexual activity outside the context of a romantic relationship although individuals in a casual relationship may engage in casual sex the former encompasses a range of activities not confined to the context of the latter in sexual relationships among teenagers in the u s it is common that penetrative sex is not the predominant sexual activity rather oral sex and manual sex are more common as this reduces the risks associated with sexual promiscuity such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections some teenagers do not view oral sex as real sex and use it to retain what they consider technical virginity a common aspect of casual sex is that sexual activity occurs within a relationship between two partners that have no commitment to one another casual sex presents itself as less risky than random sexual activity because of the person s prior knowledge of the partner they are engaging in sexual activity with when participating in casual sex a person may be more likely to know their partner on a more personal level than

synonyms include non consensual non monogamy cheating straying adultery being unfaithful two timing or having an affair is a violation of a couple s emotional or sexual exclusivity that commonly results in feelings of anger sexual jealousy and rivalry what constitutes infidelity depends on expectations within the relationship in marital relationships exclusivity is commonly assumed infidelity can cause psychological damage including feelings of rage and betrayal depression low sexual and personal confidence and even post traumatic stress disorder people of both sexes can experience social consequences if their act of infidelity becomes public but the form and extent of these consequences can depend on the gender of the unfaithful person incidence after the kinsey reports came out in the early 1950s findings suggested that historically and cross culturally extramarital sex has been a matter of regulation more than sex before marriage the kinsey reports found that around half of men and a quarter of women studied had committed adultery the janus report on sexual behavior in america also reported that one third of married men and a quarter of women have had an extramarital affair according to the new york times the most consistent data on infidelity comes from the university of chicago s general social survey gss interviews with people in monogamous relationships since 1972 by the gss have shown that approximately 12 of men and 7 of women admit to having had an extramarital relationship results however vary year by year and also by age group surveyed for example one study conducted by the university of washington seattle found slightly or significantly higher rates of infidelity for populations under 35 or older than 60 in that study which involved 19 065 people during a 15 year period rates of infidelity among men were found to have risen from 20 to 28 and rates for women ranged from 5 to 15 in more recent nationwide surveys several researchers found that about twice as many men as women reported having an extramarital affair a survey conducted in 1990 found that 2 2 of married participants reported having more than one partner during the past year in general national surveys conducted in the early 1990s reported that between 15 and 25 of married americans reported having extramarital affairs people who had stronger sexual interests more permissive sexual values lower subjective satisfaction with their partner weaker network ties to their partner and greater sexual opportunities were more likely to be unfaithful studies suggest around 30 40 of unmarried relationships and 18 20 of marriages see at least one incident of sexual infidelity rates of infidelity among women are thought to increase with age in one study rates were higher in more recent marriages compared with previous generations men were found to be only somewhat more likely than women to engage in infidelity with rates for both sexes becoming increasingly similar another study found that the likelihood of women being involved in infidelity reached a peak in the seventh year of their marriage and then declined afterward for married men the longer they were in relationships the less likely they were to engage in infidelity until the eighteenth year of marriage at which point the chance of men engaging in infidelity began to increase research on pregnancy and its effects on sexual desire and rates of infidelity conducted in southern spain indicated that men were more likely to engage in infidelity while their partner was pregnant it was estimated that 1 in 10 fathers to be engaged in infidelity at some point during their partner s pregnancy and suggested that the likelihood of the man engaging in infidelity increases as the woman s pregnancy progresses through its trimesters one measure of infidelity is paternal discrepancy a situation that arises when someone who is presumed to be a child s father is in fact not the biological parent frequencies as high as 30 are sometimes assumed in the media but research by sociologist michael gilding traced these overestimates back to an informal remark at a 1972 conference the detection of paternal discrepancy can occur in the context of medical genetic screening in genetic family name research and in immigration testing such studies show that paternal discrepancy is in fact less than 10 among the sampled african populations less than 5 among the sampled native american and polynesian populations less than 2 of the sampled middle eastern population and generally 1 2 among european samples gender differences in sexual infidelity as a function of gender have been commonly reported the national health and social life survey found that 4 of married men 16 of cohabiting men and 37 of dating men engaged in acts of sexual infidelity in the previous year compared to 1 of married women 8 of cohabiting women and 17 of women in dating relationships these differences have been generally thought due to evolutionary pressures that motivate men towards sexual opportunity and women towards commitment to one partner for reasons such as reproductive success stability and social expectations in addition recent research finds that differences in gender may possibly be explained by other mechanisms including power and sensations seeking for example one study found that some women in more financially independent and higher positions of power were also more likely to be more unfaithful to their partners in another study when the tendency to sensation seek i e engage in risky behaviours was controlled for there were no gender differences in the likelihood to being unfaithful these findings suggest there may be various factors that might influence the likelihood of some individuals to engage in extradyadic relationships and that such factors may account for observed gender differences beyond actual gender and evolutionary pressures associated with each gender differences there is currently debate in the field of evolutionary psychology whether an innate evolved sex difference exists between men and women in response to an act of infidelity this is often called a sex difference a study published in 2002 suggested there may be sex differences in jealousy those that posit a sex difference exists state that men are 60 more likely to be disturbed by an act of sexual infidelity having one s partner engage in sexual relations with another whereas women are 83 more likely to be disturbed by an act of emotional infidelity having one s partner fall in love with another those against this model argue that there is no difference between men and women in their response to an act of infidelity from an evolutionary perspective men are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as little as possible in their offspring and producing as many offspring as possible due to the risk of males investing in children that are not theirs women who do not face the risk of cuckoldry are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as much as possible in their offspring because they invest at least nine months of resources towards their offspring in pregnancy maximizing female fitness is theorized to require males in the relationship to invest all their resources in the offspring these conflicting strategies are theorized to have resulted in selection of different jealousy mechanisms that are designed to enhance the fitness of the respective gender a common way to test whether an innate jealousy response exists between sexes is to use a forced choice questionnaire this style of questionnaire asks participants yes or no and response a or response b style questions about certain scenarios for example a question might ask if you found your partner cheating on you would you be more upset by a the sexual involvement or b the emotional involvement many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women furthermore studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures although forced choice questionnaires show a statistically significant sex difference critics of the theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy question these findings in consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences c f harris asserted that when methods other than forced choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference inconsistencies between studies begin to arise for example researchers found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity the results of these studies also depended on the context in which the participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt as well as the intensity of their jealousy in her meta analysis harris raises the question of whether forced choice questionnaires actually measure what they purport jealousy itself and evidence that differences in jealousy arise from innate mechanisms her meta analysis reveals that sex differences are almost exclusively found in forced choice studies according to harris a meta analysis of multiple types of studies should indicate a convergence of evidence and multiple operationalizations this is not the case which raises the question as to the validity of forced choice studies desteno and bartlett 2002 further support this argument by providing evidence which indicates that significant results of forced choice studies may actually be an artifact of measurement this finding would invalidate many of the claims made by those in favor of an innate sex difference even those in favor of sex differences admit that certain lines of research such as homicide studies suggest against the possibility of sex differences these inconsistent results have led researchers to propose novel theories that attempt to explain the sex differences observed in certain studies one theory that has been hypothesized to explain why men and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories studies have found that attachment styles of adults are consistent with their self reported relationship histories for example more men are reported to have an insecure dismissing avoidant attachment style where these individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience deny needs for intimacy are highly invested in autonomy and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles levy and kelly 2010 tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy individuals who have secure attachment styles often report that emotional infidelity is more upsetting whereas dismissing attachment styles were more likely to find sexual infidelity more upsetting their study did report that men in general were more likely than women to report sexual infidelity as more distressing however this could be related to more men having a dismissing attachment style the authors propose that a social mechanism may be responsible for the observed results in other words replicable sex differences in emotion and sexual jealousy could be a function of a social function similar studies focusing on the masculinization and feminization by society also argue for a social explanation while discounting an evolutionary explanation a 2015 study found a correlation between avpr1a expression and predisposition to extrapair mating in women but not in men sexual orientation evolutionary researchers have suggested that men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous this is especially true for certain types of infidelity it has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity and vice versa for heterosexual women because potential cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male who could potentially invest in offspring of another male while for females emotional infidelity is more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment to another woman s offspring therefore affecting their chances of survival however more recent studies suggest that increasingly both men and women would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse symons 1979 determined that sexual jealousy is the major reason that many homosexual men are unsuccessful in maintaining monogamous relationships and suggests that all men are innately disposed to want sexual variation with the difference between heterosexual and homosexual men being that homosexual men can find willing partners more often for casual sex and thus satisfy this innate desire for sexual variety however according to this view all men can be hard wired to be sexually jealous and therefore gay men could be more upset by sexual infidelity than by emotional infidelity and that lesbians could be more upset by emotional infidelity than sexual recent studies suggest that it may not be an innate mechanism rather depends on the importance placed on sexual exclusivity peplau and cochran 1983 found that sexual exclusivity was much more important to heterosexual men and women compared to homosexual men and women this theory suggests that it is not sexuality that may lead to differences but that people are prone to jealousy in domains that are especially important to them barah and lipton argue that heterosexual couples may cheat just as much as homosexual relationships harris 2002 tested these hypotheses among 210 individuals 48 homosexual women 50 homosexual men 40 heterosexual women and 49 heterosexual men results found that more heterosexual than homosexual individuals picked sexual infidelity as worse than emotional infidelity with heterosexual men being the highest and that when forced to choose gay men overwhelmingly predicted emotional infidelity would be more troubling than sexual infidelity these findings contradict symons 1979 suggestion that there would be no gender difference in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation blow and bartlett 2005 suggest that even though sex outside of a homosexual relationship might be seen as more acceptable in some relationships the consequences of infidelity do not occur without pain or jealousy heterosexuals rated emotional and sexual infidelity as more emotionally distressing than did lesbian and gay individuals sex and sexual orientation differences emerged regarding the degree to which specific emotions were reported in response to sexual and emotional infidelity few researchers have explored the influence of sexual orientation on which type of infidelity is viewed as more distressing summarizing the findings from these studies heterosexual men seem to be more distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women lesbian women and gay men these latter three groups seem more responsible for this difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men however within sex analyses reveal that heterosexual men tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity responses some studies suggest that only a small percentage of couples that experience infidelity actually improve their relationship whereas others report couples having surprisingly positive relationship outcomes in terms of negative responses to infidelity charney and parnass 1995 report that after hearing of a partner s infidelity reactions have included rage and increased aggressiveness loss of trust decreased personal and sexual confidence sadness depression damaged self esteem fear of abandonment and a surge of justification to leave their partner another study reported that nearly 60 of the partners that were cheated on had emotional problems and depression following disclosure of the affair other negative consequences have included damage to relationships with children parents and friends as well as legal consequences a report in 1983 detailed that of a sample of 205 divorced individuals about one half said their marital problems were caused by their spouse s infidelity the negative impact of infidelity on a relationship depends on how involved partners are in their infidelity relationship and researchers maintain that infidelity itself does not cause divorce but the overall level of relationship satisfaction motives for infidelity level of conflict and attitudes held about infidelity do in fact schneider et al 1999 reported that even though 60 of their participants initially threatened to leave their primary relationship a threat to leave due to infidelity did not actually predict the eventual outcome atkins eldridge baucom and christiansen found that couples who went through therapy as well as openly dealt with the infidelity were able to change at a faster rate than distressed couples who were just in therapy some unintended positive outcomes that have been reported for couples experiencing infidelity include closer marital relationships increased assertiveness taking better care of oneself placing higher value on family and realizing the importance of marital communication if divorce results from infidelity research suggest that the faithful spouse may experience feelings of low life satisfaction and self esteem they may also engage in future relationships fearful of the same incidence occurring sweeney and horwitz 2001 found that individuals who initiated a divorce after hearing about their partner s infidelity experienced less depression however the opposite was true when the offending spouse initiated divorce according to attachment theory intimates evaluate the availability of close others and respond to them accordingly while those with a secure attachment style believe others are available to them those with insecure attachment believe others are less available to them people who develop high levels of attachment have more anxiety and uncertainty they cope by seeking reassurance and clinging themselves to another person in attachment theory people seek sex to help meet their needs those whose partners are unfaithful may experience anxiety stress and depression they are more likely to engage in activities that are risky to their health women who experienced negative appraisals like self blame and causal attribution led to emotional distress and increased health compromising behavior gender self esteem greatly affects infidelity different factors for the two genders are known to influence jealousy heterosexual men seem to be more distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women lesbian women and gay men the latter three groups seem more responsible for the difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men causes studies have found that men are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied sexually while women are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally kimmel and van der veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs one study done by roscoe cavanaugh and kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity whereas men reported a lack of communication understanding and sexual incompatibility glass and wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone in general marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes it is important to note that there are many other factors that increase the likelihood of anyone engaging in infidelity individuals exhibiting sexually permissive attitudes and those who have had a high number of past sexual relationships are also more likely to engage in infidelity other factors such as being well educated living in an urban centre being less religious having a liberal ideology and values having more opportunities to meet potential partners and being older affected the likelihood of one being involved in an extramarital affair anthropological viewpoint anthropologists tend to believe humans are neither completely monogamous nor completely polygamous anthropologist bobbi low says we are slightly polygamous while deborah blum believes we are ambiguously monogamous and slowly moving away from the polygamous habits of our evolutionary ancestors according to anthropologist helen fisher there are numerous psychological reasons for adultery some people may want to supplement a marriage solve a sex problem gather more attention seek revenge or have more excitement in the marriage but based on fisher s research there also is a biological side to adultery we have two brain systems one of them is linked to attachment and romantic love and then there is the other brain system which is purely sex drive sometimes these two brain systems are not well connected which enables people to become adulterers and satisfy their libido without any regards to their attachment side cultural variation often gender differences in both jealousy and infidelity are attributable to cultural factors this variation stems from the fact that societies differ in how they view extramarital affairs and jealousy an examination of jealousy across seven nations revealed that each partner in a relationship serves as each other s primary and exclusive source of satisfaction and attention in all cultures therefore when an individual feels jealousy towards another it is usually because they are now sharing their primary source of attention and satisfaction however variation can be seen when identifying the behaviors and actions that betray the role of primary attention satisfaction giver for instance in certain cultures if an individual goes out with another of the opposite gender emotions of intense jealousy can result however in other cultures this behavior is perfectly acceptable and is not given much thought it is important to understand where these cultural variations come from and how they root themselves into differing perceptions of infidelity while many cultures report infidelity as wrong and admonish it some are more tolerant of such behaviour these views are generally linked to the overall liberal nature of the society for instance danish society is viewed as more liberal than many other cultures and as such have correlating liberal views on infidelity and extramarital affairs according to christine harris and nicholas christenfeld societies that are legally more liberal against extramarital affairs judge less harshly upon sexual infidelity because it is distinct from emotional infidelity in danish society having sex does not necessarily imply a deep emotional attachment as a result infidelity does not carry such a severe negative connotation a comparison between modern day chinese and american societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the u s than in china the cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of chinese society thus making infidelity a more salient concern sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the united states thus it follows that american society is more preoccupied with infidelity than chinese society often a single predominant religion can influence the culture of an entire nation even within christianity in the united states there are discrepancies as to how extramarital affairs are viewed for instance protestants and catholics do not view infidelity with equal severity the conception of marriage is also markedly different while in roman catholicism marriage is seen as an indissoluble sacramental bond and does not permit divorce even in cases of infidelity most protestant denominations allow for divorce and remarriage for infidelity or other reasons ultimately it was seen that adults that associated with a religion any denomination were found to view infidelity as much more distressing than those who were not affiliated with a religion those that participated more heavily in their religions were even more conservative in their views on infidelity some research has also suggested that being african american has a positive correlation to infidelity even when education attainment is controlled for other research suggests that lifetime incidence of infidelity does not differ between african americans and whites only the likelihood of when they engage in it race and gender have been found to be positively correlated with infidelity however this is the case more often for african american men engaging in extramarital infidelity human mating strategies differ from culture to culture for example schmitt discusses how tribal cultures with higher pathogen stress are more likely to have polygynous marriage systems whereas monogamous mating systems usually have relatively lower high pathogen environments in addition researchers have also proposed the idea that high mortality rates in local cultures should be correlated with more permissive mating strategies on the other hand schmitt discusses how demanding reproductive environments should increase the desire and pursuit of biparental monogamous relationships strategic pluralism theory strategic pluralism is a theory that focuses on how environmental factors influence mating strategies according to this theory when people live within environments that are demanding and stressful the need for bi parental care is greater for increasing the survival of offspring correspondingly monogamy and commitment are more commonplace on the other hand when people live within environments that encompass little stress and threats to the viability of offspring the need for serious and committed relations is lowered and therefore promiscuity and infidelity are more common sex ratio theory sex ratio theory is a theory that explains the relationship and sexual dynamics within different areas of the world based on the ratio of the number of marriage aged men to marriage aged women according to this theory an area has a high sex ratio when there is a higher number of marriage aged women to marriage aged men and an area has a low sex ratio when there are more marriage aged men in terms of infidelity the theory states that when sex ratios are high men are more likely to be promiscuous and engage in sex outside of a committed relationship because the demand for men is higher and this type of behavior desired by men is more accepted on the other hand when sex ratios are low promiscuity is less common because women are in demand and since they desire monogamy and commitment in order for men to remain competitive in the pool of mates they must respond to these desires support for this theory comes from evidence showing higher divorce rates in countries with higher sex ratios and higher monogamy rates in countries with lower sex ratios other contributing factors while infidelity is by no means exclusive to certain groups of people its perception can be influenced by other factors furthermore within a homogeneous culture like that in the united states factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived larger communities tend to care less about infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues these patterns are observed in other cultures as well for example a cantina in a small rural mexican community is often viewed as a place where decent or married women do not go because of its semi private nature conversely public spaces like the market or plaza are acceptable areas for heterosexual interaction a smaller population size presents the threat of being publicly recognized for infidelity however within a larger community of the same mexican society entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view it would be deemed perfectly acceptable for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city these observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the united states as well ultimately these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures mate poaching is the phenomenon of a single person luring a person who is in an intimate relationship to leave their partner for the single person according to a survey of 16 964 individuals in 53 countries by david schmitt 2001 mate poaching happens significantly more frequently in middle eastern countries such as turkey and lebanon and less frequently in east asian countries such as china and japan evolutionary factors the parental investment theory is used to explain evolutionary pressures that can account for sex differences in infidelity this theory states that the sex that invests less in the offspring has more to gain from indiscriminate sexual behaviour this means that women who typically invest more time and energy into raising their offspring 9 months of carrying offspring breast feeding etc should be more choosy when it comes to mate selection and should therefore desire long term monogamous relationships that would ensure the viability of their offspring men on the other hand have less parental investment and so they are driven towards indiscriminate sexual activity with multiple partners as such activity increases the likelihood of their reproduction this theory says that it is these evolutionary pressures that act on men and women differentially and what ultimately drives more men to seek sexual activity outside of their own relationships it can however still account for the occurrence of extradyadic sexual relationships among women for example a woman whose husband has fertilization difficulties can benefit from engaging in sexual activity outside of her relationship she can gain access to high quality genes and still derive the benefit of parental investment from her husband or partner who is unknowingly investing in their illegitimate child evidence for the development of such a short term mating strategy in women comes from findings that women who engage in affairs typically do so with men who are of higher status dominance physical attractiveness which is indicative of genetic quality defense mechanisms one defense mechanism that some researchers believe is effective at preventing infidelity is jealousy jealousy is an emotion that can elicit strong responses cases have been commonly documented where sexual jealousy was a direct cause of murders and morbid jealousy buss 2005 states that jealousy has three main functions to help prevent infidelity these suggestions are it can alert an individual to threats with a valued relationship it can be activated by the presence of interested and more desirable intrasexual rivals it can function as a motivational mechanism that creates behavioral outputs to deter infidelity and abandonment looking at jealousy s physiological mechanism offers support for this idea jealousy is a form of stress response which has been shown to activate the sympathetic nervous system by increasing heart rate blood pressure and respiration this will activate the fight or flight response to ensure action against the attempt at sexual infidelity in their partner buss and his colleagues were the first to pioneer a theory that jealousy is an evolved human emotion that has become an innate module hard wired to prevent infidelity from occurring this idea is commonly referred to as jealousy as a specific innate module and has become widely debated the basis behind this argument is that jealousy was beneficial in our ancestor s time when cuckoldry was more common they suggested that those who were equipped with this emotional response could more effectively stop infidelity and those without the emotional response had a harder time doing so because infidelity imposed such a fitness cost those who had the jealous emotional response improved their fitness and could pass down the jealousy module to the next generation another defense mechanism for preventing infidelity is by social monitoring and acting on any violation of expectations researchers in favor of this defense mechanism speculate that in our ancestor s times the act of sex or emotional infidelity is what triggered jealousy and therefore the signal detection would have happened only after infidelity had occurred making jealousy an emotional by product with no selective function in line with this reasoning these researchers hypothesize that as a person monitors their partner s actions with a potential rival through primary and secondary appraisals if their expectations are violated at either level of observation they will become distressed and enact an appropriate action to stop the chance of infidelity social monitoring therefore enables them to act accordingly before infidelity occurs thereby having the capability to raise their fitness research testing this theory has found more favor for the sexual jealousy hypothesis a more recently suggested defense mechanism of infidelity attracting more attention is that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their reputation the basis for this suggestion stems from the fact that humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters regardless of the context this punishment comes in many forms one of which is gossip this damage will impair the future benefits that individual can confer from the group and its individuals a damaged reputation is especially debilitating when related to sexual and emotional infidelity because it can limit future reproductive mate choices within the group and will cause a net fitness cost that outweighs the fitness benefit gained from the infidelity such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place support for this defense mechanism comes from fieldwork by hirsch and his colleagues 2007 that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region specifically adultery was found to cause an individual to be disowned by their family decrease the marriage value of his her family cause an individual to lose money or a job and diminish future reproductive potential in this community men having extramarital affairs did so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community such as bars and brothels both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections the internet the proliferation of sex chat rooms and dating apps has increased the opportunity for people in committed relationships to engage in acts of infidelity on and off the internet a cyber affair is defined as a romantic or sexual relationship initiated by online contact and maintained primarily via online communication sexual acts online include behaviors such as cybersex where two or more individuals engage in discussions about sexual fantasies over the internet and is usually accompanied by masturbation hot chatting where discussions between two or more people move away from light hearted flirting and emotional acts where people disclose intimate information to a significant other a new type of sexual activity online is when two people s avatars engage in sexual activity in virtual reality worlds such as second life the majority of americans believe that if a partner engaged in cybersex this constitutes as an act of infidelity spread of online communications also widened the gray area of the definition of infidelity so called microcheating a 2005 survey of 1828 participants reported one third of them reported engaging in cybersex and of that one third 46 said they were in a committed relationship with someone else in an attempt to differentiate offline and online infidelity cooper morahan martin mathy and maheu constructed a triple a engine which identifies the three aspects of internet infidelity that distinguish it to some degree from traditional infidelity accessibility the more access one has to the internet the more likely they will engage in infidelity affordability the monetary cost of being able to access the internet continues to drop and for a small price a user can visit many sites and meet multiple potential sexual needs anonymity the internet allows users to masquerade as someone else or hide their identity altogether in a study of 335 dutch undergraduate students involved in serious intimate relationships participants were presented with four dilemmas concerning a partner s emotional and sexual infidelity over the internet they found a significant sex difference as to whether participants chose sexual and emotional infidelity as more upsetting more men than women indicated that a partner s sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner s emotional bonding with someone else similarly in the dilemma involving infidelity over the internet more men indicated their partner s sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner s emotional bonding with someone else women on the other hand expressed more problems with emotional infidelity over the internet than did men online infidelity can be just as damaging to a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness a possible explanation is that our brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly several studies have concluded that online infidelity whether sexual or emotional in nature often leads to off line infidelity chat rooms a study by beatriz lia avila mileham in 2004 examined the phenomenon of online infidelity in chat rooms the following factors were investigated what elements and dynamics online infidelity involves and how it happens what leads individuals specifically to the computer to search for a relationship on the side whether individuals consider online contacts as infidelity and why or why not and what dynamics chat room users experience in their marriages the results led to three constructs that symbolize chat room dynamics and serve as a foundation for internet infidelity anonymous sexual interactionism the individuals predilection for anonymous interactions of a sexual nature in chat rooms the allure of anonymity gains extra importance for married individuals who can enjoy relative safety to express fantasies and desires without being known or exposed behavioral rationalization the reasoning that chat room users present for conceiving their online behaviors as innocent and harmless despite the secrecy and highly sexual nature effortless avoidance chat room users lack of psychological discomfort in exchanging sexual messages with strangers legal implications all countries in europe as well as most countries in latin america have decriminalized adultery however in many countries in africa and asia particularly the middle east this type of infidelity is criminalized even where infidelity is not a criminal offense it may have legal implications in divorce cases for example it may be a factor in property settlement the custody of children the denial of alimony etc in civil claims not only the spouse but also the other man other woman may be held accountable for example seven us states hawaii illinois north carolina mississippi new mexico south dakota and utah allow the possibility of the tort action of alienation of affections brought by a deserted spouse against a third party alleged to be responsible for the failure of the marriage in a highly publicized case in 2010 a woman in north carolina won a 9 million suit against her husband s mistress in the united states criminal laws relating to infidelity vary and those states that criminalize adultery rarely prosecute the offense penalties for adultery range from life imprisonment in michigan to a 10 fine in maryland or class 1 felony in wisconsin the constitutionality of us criminal laws on adultery is unclear due to supreme court decisions in 1965 giving privacy of sexual intimacy to consenting adults as well as broader implications of lawrence v texas 2003 adultery is declared to be illegal in 21 states in many jurisdictions adultery may have indirect legal implications particularly in cases of infliction of violence such as domestic assaults and killings in particular by mitigating murder to manslaughter or otherwise providing for partial or complete defenses in case of violence especially in cultures where there is a traditional toleration of crimes of passion and honor killings such provisions have been condemned by the council of europe and the united nations in recent years the council of europe recommendation rec 2002 5 of the committee of ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence states that member states should 57 preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family un women has also stated in regard to the defense of provocation and other similar defenses laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of honour adultery or domestic assault or murder workplace issues as the number of women in the workforce increases to match that of men researchers expect the likelihood of infidelity will also increase with workplace interactions wiggins and lederer 1984 found that opportunities to engage in infidelity were related to the workplace where nearly one half of their samples who engaged in infidelity were involved with coworkers a study done by mckinnish 2007 found that those who work with a larger fraction of workers of the opposite sex are more likely to be divorced due to infidelity kuroki found that married women were less likely to have a workplace affair whereas self employed individuals are more likely in 2000 treas and giesen found similar results where sexual opportunities in the workplace increased the likelihood of infidelity during the last 12 months adulterous office romances are widely considered to be unhelpful to business and work relationships and superior subordinate relationships are banned in 90 of companies with written policies regarding office romance companies cannot ban adultery as in all but a handful of states such regulations would run afoul of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status firings nonetheless often occur on the basis of charges of inappropriate office conduct academics and therapists say cheating is probably more prevalent on the road than close to home the protection of the road offers a secret life of romance far from spouses or partners affairs range from one night stands to relationships that last for years they are usually with a co worker a business associate or someone they repeatedly encounter another reason for the development of office romances is the amount of time co workers spend together spouses today often spend more time with co workers in the office than with each other a newsweek article notes nearly 60 percent of american women work outside the home up from about 40 percent in 1964 quite simply women intersect with more people during the day than they used to they go to more meetings take more business trips and presumably participate more in flirtatious water cooler chatter according to debra laino in an article for shave some of the reasons women cheat at the workplace are because women are disproportionately exposed to men in the workplace and as a direct consequence many have more options and chances to cheat alternative views swinging and polyamory swinging is a form of extradyadic sex where married couples exchange partners with each other swinging was originally called wife swapping but due to the sexist connotations and the fact that many wives were willing to swap partners mate swapping and or swinging was substituted the supreme court of canada has ruled swinging is legal as long as it takes place in a private place and is consensual swinging can be closed or open where couples meet and each pair goes off to a separate room or they have sex in the same room the majority of swingers fall into the middle and upper classes with an above average education and income and majority of these swingers are white 90 a study done by jenks in 1986 found that swingers are not significantly different from non swingers on measures such as philosophy authoritarianism self respect happiness freedom equality etc swingers tend to emphasize personal values over more social ones according to henshel 1973 the initiation into the world of swinging usually is done by the husband reasons for getting involved in swinging are the variety of sexual partners and experiences pleasure or excitement meeting new people and voyeurism in order for swinging to work both partners need to have a liberal sexual predisposition and a low degree of jealousy gilmartin 1975 found that 85 of his sample of swingers felt that these sexual encounters posed no real threat to their marriage and felt it had improved jenks 1998 found no reason to believe that swinging was detrimental to marriage with over 91 of males and 82 of females indicating they were happy with swinging another form of extradyadic sex is polyamory a non possessive honest responsible and ethical philosophy and practice of loving multiple people simultaneously there are various types of relationships in polyamory such as intentional family group relationship and group marriage one type of group relationship can be a triad involving a married couple and an additional person who all share sexual intimacy however it is usually an addition of a female unlike polygyny or polyandry both men and women may have multiple partners within the confines of polyamory polyamorous relationships are distinguished from extramarital affairs by the full disclosure and consent of all involved polyamorous relationships may specify unique boundaries outside monogamous expectations of fidelity that if violated are still considered cheating because both men and women can have multiple partners these individuals do not consider themselves to be either uncommitted or unfaithful see also crime of

"Grief": "grief is the response to the loss of something deemed important particularly to the death of a person to whom or animal to which a bond or affection was formed although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss grief also has physical cognitive behavioral social cultural spiritual and philosophical dimensions while the terms are often used interchangeably bereavement refers to the state of loss while grief is the reaction to that loss the grief associated with death is familiar to most people but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives such as unemployment ill health or the end of a relationship loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract physical loss is related to something that the individual can touch or measure such as losing a spouse through death while other types of loss are more abstract possibly relating to aspects of a person s social interactions grieving process between 1996 and 2006 there was extensive skepticism about a universal and predictable emotional pathway that leads from distress to recovery with an appreciation that grief is a more complex process of adapting to loss than stage and phase models have previously suggested the two track model of bereavement created by simon shimshon rubin in 1981 provided a deeper focus on the grieving process the model examines the long term effects of bereavement by measuring how well the person is adapting to the loss of a significant person in their life the main objective of the two track model of bereavement is for the individual to manage and live in reality in which the deceased is absent as well as return to normal biological functioning track one is focused on the biopsychosocial functioning of grief this focuses on the anxiety depression somatic concerns traumatic responses familial relationships interpersonal relationships self esteem meaning structure work and investment in life tasks rubin 2010 points out track 1 the range of aspects of the individual s functioning across affective interpersonal somatic and classical psychiatric indicators is considered all of the terms listed above are noted for the importance they have in relation to people s responses to grief and loss the significance of the closeness between the bereaved and the deceased is important to track 1 because this could determine the severity of the mourning and grief the bereaved will endure this first track is the response to extremely stressful life events and requires adaptation change and integration the second track focuses on the ongoing relationship between the griever and the deceased track two mainly focuses on how the bereaved was connected to the deceased and what level of closeness was shared the two main components considered are positive and negative memories and emotional involvement shared with the decedent the stronger the relationship with the deceased the greater the evaluation of the relationship with heightened shock any memory could be a trigger for the bereaved the way the bereaved chose to remember their loved ones and how the bereaved integrate the memory of their loved ones into their daily lives ten main attributes to this track include imagery memory emotional distance positive effect negative effect preoccupation with the loss conflict idealization memorialization transformation of the loss impact on self perception and loss process shock searching disorganized an outcome of this track is being able to recognize how transformation has occurred beyond grief and mourning by outlining the main aspects of the bereavement process into two interactive tracks individuals can examine and understand how grief has affected their life following loss and begin to adapt to this post loss life the model offers a better understanding of the duration of time in the wake of one s loss and the outcomes that evolve from death using this model researchers can effectively examine the response to an individual s loss by assessing the behavioral psychological functioning and the relationship with the deceased the authors from what s your grief litza williams and eleanor haley state in their understanding of the clinical and therapeutic uses of the model in terms of functioning this model can help the bereaved identify which areas of his her life has been impacted by the grief in a negative way as well as areas that the bereaved has already begun to adapt to after the loss if the bereaved is unable to return to their normal functioning as in before loss occurred it is likely they will find difficulty in the process of working through the loss as well as their separation from the deceased along the relational aspect the bereaved can become aware of their relationship with the deceased and how it has changed or may change in the future williams haley 2017 the two track model of bereavement can help specify areas of mutuality how people respond affectivity to trauma and change and also difference how bereaved people may be preoccupied with the deceased following loss compared to how they may be preoccupied with trauma following the exposure to it rubin s s 1999 while the grief response is considered a natural way of dealing with loss prolonged highly intense grief may at times become debilitating enough to be considered a disorder reactions crying is a normal and natural part of grieving it has also been found however that crying and talking about the loss is not the only healthy response and if forced or excessive can be harmful responses or actions in the affected person called coping ugly by researcher george bonanno may seem counter intuitive or even appear dysfunctional e g celebratory responses laughter or self serving bias in interpreting events lack of crying is also a natural healthy reaction potentially protective of the individual and may also be seen as a sign of resilience science has found that some healthy people who are grieving do not spontaneously talk about the loss pressing people to cry or retell the experience of a loss can be damaging genuine laughter is healthy when a loved one dies it is not unusual for the bereaved to report that they have seen or heard the person they have lost most people who have experienced this report feeling comforted in a 2008 survey conducted by amanda barusch 27 of respondents who had lost a loved one reported having had this kind of contact experience bereavement science bonanno s four trajectories of grief george bonanno a professor of clinical psychology at columbia university conducted more than two decades of scientific studies on grief and trauma which have been published in several papers in the most respected peer reviewed journals in the field of psychology such as psychological science and the journal of abnormal psychology subjects of his studies number in the several thousand and include people who have suffered losses in the u s and cross cultural studies in various countries around the world such as israel bosnia herzegovina and china his subjects suffered losses through war terrorism deaths of children premature deaths of spouses sexual abuse childhood diagnoses of aids and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events in bonanno s book the other side of sadness what the new science of bereavement tells us about life after a loss he summarizes his research his findings include that a natural resilience is the main component of grief and trauma reactions the first researcher to use pre loss data he outlined four trajectories of grief bonanno s work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research because grief responses can take many forms including laughter celebration and bawdiness in addition to sadness bonanno coined the phrase coping ugly to describe the idea that some forms of coping may seem counter intuitive bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans suggesting that it cannot be taught through specialized programs and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs the four trajectories are as follows resilience the ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life threatening situation to maintain relatively stable healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning as well as the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions recovery when normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or sub threshold psychopathology e g symptoms of depression or post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd usually for a period of at least several months and then gradually returns to pre event levels chronic dysfunction prolonged suffering and inability to function usually lasting several years or longer delayed grief or trauma when adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later researchers have not found evidence of delayed grief but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon five stages model the k\u00fcbler ross model commonly known as the five stages of grief describes a hypothesis first introduced by elisabeth k\u00fcbler ross in her 1969 book on death and dying based on the uncredited earlier work of john bowlby and colin murray parkes k\u00fcbler ross actually applied the stages to people who were dying not people who were grieving the five stages are denial anger bargaining depression acceptance this model found limited empirical support in a study by maciejewski et al that is that the sequence was correct although acceptance was highest at all points throughout the person s experience the research of george bonanno however is acknowledged as debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer reviewed studies show that the vast majority of people who have experienced a loss are resilient and that there are multiple trajectories following loss physiological and neurological processes studies of fmri scans of women from whom grief was elicited about the death of a mother or a sister in the past 5 years resulted in the conclusion that grief produced a local inflammation response as measured by salivary concentrations of pro inflammatory cytokines these responses were correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex this activation also correlated with the free recall of grief related word stimuli this suggests that grief can cause stress and that this reaction is linked to the emotional processing parts of the frontal lobe activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and vagus nerve is similarly implicated in the experience of heartbreak whether due to social rejection or bereavement among those persons who have been bereaved within the previous three months of a given report those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivity to reminders of their loss in the case of the amygdala this links to their sadness intensity in those individuals who avoid such thoughts there is a related opposite type of pattern in which there is a decrease in the activation of the dorsal amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in those not so emotionally affected by reminders of their loss studies of fmri scans have been used to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter in those people who had greater intensity of sadness there was a low functional connection between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter evolutionary hypotheses from an evolutionary perspective grief is perplexing because it appears costly and it is not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief attempting to solve this puzzle sigmund freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment the griever must freud argued disinvest from the deceased which is a painful process but this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other possibly new attachments so it provides a valuable function john archer approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system generally a grief type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual e g a mother or a child however in the case of death the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased grief from this perspective is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments other researchers such as randolph nesse have proposed that grief is a kind of psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory if for example leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole led to the offspring s death grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole more recently bo winegard and colleagues argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual s propensity for forming strong committed relationships from this social signaling perspective grief targets old and new social partners informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments that is because grief signals a person s capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners the authors argue that throughout human evolution grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners risks bereavement while a normal part of life carries a degree of risk when severe severe reactions affect approximately 10 to 15 of people severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the death of a child for example others have found no increase john james author of the grief recovery handbook and founder of the grief recovery institute reported that his marriage broke up after the death of his infant son health risks many studies have looked at the bereaved in terms of increased risks for stress related illnesses colin murray parkes in the 1960s and 1970s in england noted increased doctor visits with symptoms such as abdominal pain breathing difficulties and so forth in the first six months following a death others have noted increased mortality rates ward a w 1976 and bunch et al found a five times greater risk of suicide in teens following the death of a parent bereavement also increases the risk of heart attack complicated grief prolonged grief disorder pgd formerly known as complicated grief disorder cgd is a pathological reaction to loss representing a cluster of empirically derived symptoms that have been associated with long term physical and psycho social dysfunction individuals with pgd experience severe grief symptoms for at least six months and are stuck in a maladaptive state an attempt is being made to create a diagnosis category for complicated grief in the dsm 5 it is currently an area for further study in the dsm under the name persistent complex bereavement disorder critics of including the diagnosis of complicated grief in the dsm 5 say that doing so will constitute characterizing a natural response as a pathology and will result in wholesale medicating of people who are essentially normal shear and colleagues found an effective treatment for complicated grief by treating the reactions in the same way as trauma reactions complicated grief is not synonymous with grief complicated grief is characterised by an extended grieving period and other criteria including mental and physical impairments an important part of understanding complicated grief is understanding how the symptoms differ from normal grief the mayo clinic states that with normal grief the feelings of loss are evident when the reaction turns into complicated grief however the feelings of loss become incapacitating and continue even though time passes the signs and symptoms characteristic of complicated grief are listed as extreme focus on the loss and reminders of the loved one intense longing or pining for the deceased problems accepting the death numbness or detachment bitterness about your loss inability to enjoy life depression or deep sadness trouble carrying out normal routines withdrawing from social activities feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose irritability or agitation lack of trust in others the symptoms seen in complicated grief are specific because the symptoms seem to be a combination of the symptoms found in separation as well as traumatic distress they are also considered to be complicated because unlike normal grief these symptoms will continue regardless of the amount of time that has passed and despite treatment given from tricyclic antidepressants individuals with complicated grief symptoms are likely to have other mental disorders such as ptsd post traumatic syndrome disorder depression anxiety etc an article by the nejm the new england journal of medicine states complicated grief cases are multifactorial and that complicated grief is distinguished from major depression and post traumatic stress disorder evidence shows that complicated grief is a more severe and prolonged version of acute grief than a completely different type of grief while only affecting 2 to 3 of people in the world complicated grief is usually contracted when a loved one dies suddenly and in a violent way in the study bereavement and late life depression grief and its complications in the elderly six subjects with symptoms of complicated grief were given a dose of paroxetine a selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor and showed a 50 decrease in their symptoms within a three month period the mental health clinical research team theorizes that the symptoms of complicated grief in bereaved elderly are an alternative of post traumatic stress these symptoms were correlated with cancer hypertension anxiety depression suicidal ideation increased smoking and sleep impairments at around six months after spousal death a treatment that has been found beneficial in dealing with the symptoms associated with complicated grief is the use of serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine these inhibitors have been found to reduce intrusive thoughts avoidant behaviors and hyperarousal that are associated with complicated grief in addition psychotherapy techniques are in the process of being developed disenfranchised grief disenfranchised grief is a term describing grief that is not acknowledged by society examples of events leading to disenfranchised grief are the death of a friend the loss of a pet a trauma in the family a generation prior the loss of a home or place of residence particularly in the case of children who generally have little or no control in such situations and whose grief may not be noticed or understood by caregivers american military children and teens in particular moving a great deal while growing up an aborted or miscarried pregnancy a parent s loss or surrender of a child to adoption a child s loss of their birth parent to adoption the death of a loved one due to a socially unacceptable cause such as suicide or the death of a celebrity there are fewer support systems available for people who experience disenfranchised grief compared to those who are going through a widely recognized form of grief therefore people who suffer disenfranchised grief undergo a more complicated grieving process they may feel angry and depressed due to the lack of public validation which leads to the inability to fully express their sorrow moreover they may not receive sufficient social support and feel isolated examples of bereavement death of a child death of a child can take the form of a loss in infancy such as miscarriage stillbirth neonatal death sids or the death of an older child among adults over the age of 50 approximately 11 have been predeceased by at least one of their offspring in most cases parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss this loss also bears a lifelong process one does not get over the death but instead must assimilate and live with it intervention and comforting support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide feelings of guilt whether legitimate or not are pervasive and the dependent nature of the relationship disposes parents to a variety of problems as they seek to cope with this great loss parents who suffer miscarriage or a regretful or coerced abortion may experience resentment towards others who experience successful pregnancies suicide parents may feel they cannot openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation parents family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide related bereavement following the loss of a child the difference in suicide related bereavement is that there are different reactions and ways when we respond to the loss of someone we love dearly some examples are post traumatic stress family and relationship tensions post traumatic stress pts can affect the person severely when witnessing the death of someone it can give them horrible trauma and nightmares may occur making them have a lack of sleep another reaction is family and relationship tensions having loved ones by their side could really support them but some families might lack connections or communications with one another some have different perspectives on themselves when communicating with others and might keep their feelings to themselves it is a way to protect their inner feelings as if they re scared to share with others death of a spouse many widows and widowers describe losing half of themselves a factor is the manner in which the spouse died the survivor of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence often the spouse who is left behind may suffer from depression and loneliness and may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life furthermore most couples have a division of tasks or labor e g the husband mows the yard the wife pays the bills etc which in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes means added responsibilities for the bereaved planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre planning was not completed changes in insurance bank accounts claiming of life insurance securing childcare can also be intimidating to someone who is grieving social isolation may also become imminent as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others widows of many cultures for instance wear black for the rest of their lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years while some religions such as orthodox christianity many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives death of a sibling grieving siblings are often referred to as the forgotten mourners who are made to feel as if their grief is not as severe as their parents grief however the sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship of the lifespan and siblings who have been part of each other s lives since birth such as twins help form and sustain each other s identities with the death of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor s identity because your identity is based on having them there if siblings were not on good terms or close with each other then intense feelings of guilt may ensue on the part of the surviving sibling guilt may also ensue for having survived not being able to prevent the death having argued with their sibling etc death of a parent for an adult when an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood it is considered to be timely and to be a normative life course event this allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief however research shows that the death of a parent in an adult s midlife is not a normative event by any measure but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one s own life or mortality others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship in developed countries people typically lose parents after the age of 50 for a child for a child the death of a parent without support to manage the effects of the grief may result in long term psychological harm this is more likely if the adult carers are struggling with their own grief and are psychologically unavailable to the child there is a critical role of the surviving parent or caregiver in helping the children adapt to a parent s death however losing a parent at a young age also has some positive effects some children had an increased maturity better coping skills and improved communication adolescents who lost a parent valued other people more than those who have not experienced such a close loss loss during childhood when a parent or caregiver dies or leaves children may have symptoms of psychopathology but they are less severe than in children with major depression the loss of a parent grandparent or sibling can be very troubling in childhood but even in childhood there are age differences in relation to the loss a very young child under one or two may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies but other children may be affected by the loss at a time when trust and dependency are formed even mere separation can cause problems in well being this is especially true if the loss is around critical periods such as 8 12 months when attachment and separation are at their height and even a brief separation from a parent or other caregiver can cause distress even as a child grows older death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds for example younger children see death more as a separation and may believe death is curable or temporary reactions can manifest themselves in acting out behaviors a return to earlier behaviors such as thumb sucking clinging to a toy or angry behavior though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult they feel the same intensity as children enter pre teen and teen years there is a more mature understanding adolescents may respond by delinquency or oppositely become over achievers repetitive actions are not uncommon such as washing a car repeatedly or taking up repetitive tasks such as sewing computer games etc it is an effort to stay above the grief childhood loss can predispose a child not only to physical illness but to emotional problems and an increased risk for suicide especially in the adolescent period grief can be experienced as a result of losses due to causes other than death for example women who have been physically psychologically or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to or the loss of their ability to trust this is likely to be experienced as disenfranchised grief in relation to the specific issue of child sexual abuse it has been argued by some commentators that the concepts of loss and grief offer particularly useful analytical frames for understanding both the impact of child sexual abuse and therapeutic ways to respond to it from this perspective child sexual abuse may represent for many children multiple forms of loss not only of trust but also loss of control over their bodies loss of innocence and indeed loss of their very childhoods relocations can cause children significant grief particularly if they are combined with other difficult circumstances such as neglectful or abusive parental behaviors other significant losses etc loss of a friend or classmate children may experience the death of a friend or a classmate through illness accidents suicide or violence initial support involves reassuring children that their emotional and physical feelings are normal survivor guilt or survivor s guilt also called survivor syndrome or survivor s syndrome is a mental condition that occurs when a person perceives themselves to have done wrong by surviving a traumatic event when others did not it may be found among survivors of combat natural disasters epidemics among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide and in non mortal situations such as among those whose colleagues are laid off other losses parents may grieve due to loss of children through means other than death for example through loss of custody in divorce proceedings legal termination of parental rights by the government such as in cases of child abuse through kidnapping because the child voluntarily left home either as a runaway or for overage children by leaving home legally or because an adult refuses or is unable to have contact with a parent this loss differs from the death of a child in that the grief process is prolonged or denied because of hope that the relationship will be restored grief may occur after the loss of a romantic relationship i e divorce or break up a vocation a pet animal loss a home children leaving home empty nest syndrome sibling s leaving home a friend a faith in one s religion etc a person who strongly identifies with their occupation may feel a sense of grief if they have to stop their job due to retirement being laid off injury or loss of certification those who have experienced a loss of trust will often also experience some form of grief veteran bereavement the grief of living veteran soldiers is often ignored psychological effects and post traumatic syndrome disorder have been researched and studied but very few focus on grief and bereavement specifically additionally there have been many studies conducted about families losing members who were in the military but little about soldiers themselves there are many monuments paying respect to those who were lost which emphasizes the lack of focus living veterans and soldiers get in regards to grief gradual bereavement many of the above examples of bereavement happen abruptly but there are also cases of being gradually bereft of something or someone for example the gradual loss of a loved one by alzheimer s produces a gradual grief the author kara tippetts described her dying of cancer as dying by degrees her body failing and her abilities vanishing milton crum writing about gradual bereavement says that every degree of death every death of a person s characteristics every death of a person s abilities is a bereavement sensory experiences of the deceased bereaved people often report having sensory and quasi sensory experiences of the deceased sed which were correlated with pathology like grief complications support pecuniary assistance professional support many people who grieve do not need professional help some however may seek additional support from licensed psychologists or psychiatrists support resources available to the bereaved may include grief counseling professional support groups or educational classes and peer led support groups in the united states of america local hospice agencies may provide a first contact for those seeking bereavement support it is important to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious thus mandating contacting a medical professional grief can result in depression or alcohol and drug abuse and if left untreated it can become severe enough to impact daily living it recommends contacting a medical professional if you can t deal with grief you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol you become very depressed or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life other reasons to seek medical attention may include can focus on little else but your loved one s death have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person have thoughts of guilt or self blame believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death feel as if life is not worth living have lost your sense of purpose in life wish you had died along with your loved one professionals can use multiple ways to help someone cope and move through their grief hypnosis is sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in helping patients experiencing grief hypnosis enhances and facilitates mourning and helps patients to resolve traumatic grief art therapy may also be used to allow the bereaved to process their grief in a non verbal way lichtenthal and cruess studied how bereavement specific written disclosure had benefits in helping adjust to loss and in helping improve the effects of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd prolonged grief disorder and depression directed writing helped many of the individuals who had experienced a loss of a significant relationship it involved individuals trying to make meaning out of the loss through meaning making making sense of what happened and the cause of the death or through benefit finding consideration of the global significance of the loss of one s goals and helping the family develop a greater appreciation of life this meaning making can come naturally for some but many need direct intervention to move on support groups support groups for bereaved individuals follow a diversity of patterns many are organized purely as peer to peer groups such as local chapters of the compassionate friends an international group for bereaved parents other grief support groups are led by professionals perhaps with the assistance of peers some support groups deal with specific problems such as learning to plan meals and cook for only for one person cultural differences in grieving each culture specifies manners such as rituals styles of dress or other habits as well as attitudes in which the bereaved are encouraged or expected to take part an analysis of non western cultures suggests that beliefs about continuing ties with the deceased varies in japan maintenance of ties with the deceased is accepted and carried out through religious rituals in the hopi of arizona the women go into self induced hallucinations where they conjure images of the deceased loved one to mourn and process their grief different cultures grieve in different ways but all have ways that are vital in healthy coping with the death of a loved one the american family s approach to grieving was depicted in the grief committee by t glen coughlin the short story gives an inside look at how the american culture has learned to cope with the tribulations and difficulties of grief the story is taught in the course the politics of mourning grief management in a cross cultural fiction at columbia university in those with neurodevelopmental disorders contrary to popular belief people with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic individuals and those with an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to non autistic individuals however the ways in which others interact with individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders may impact the ways in which they perceive process and express their grief this is typically seen in association with the double taboo of death and disability which leads to those with neurodevelopmental disorders often not being appropriately informed of a loss or its significance and excluded or discouraged from attending events related to the loss e g funerals moreover one of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss which is why non verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important because these are usually signs of distress and expressions of grief among this population this difficulty of expressing the emotional impact of a loss in a neuronormative way is seen across neurodevelopmental disorders and often leads to their grief reactions going unrecognized and or misunderstood by those around them for example authentic grief reactions in autistic individuals and or individuals with an intellectual disability may just be labelled as challenging behavior by those supporting and caring for them as such it is important when working with individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders to remember that they may express and understand their grief in non neuronormative ways such as in perseveration and repeating words related to death a form of echophenomena known as echothanatologia moreover it is important that caregivers and family members of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders meet them at their level of understanding and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo and the unique ways in which they may express their grief an important aspect of supporting the processing of grief for those with neurodevelopmental disorders is narrative and storytelling as this can help individuals understand death and loss and express their grief at a level appropriate to their own understanding moreover another important aspect of support is family involvement where possible which should focus on promoting inclusion in events before and after the loss e g visiting hospital to see a dying relative attending the funeral being able to visit the grave etc and ensuring individuals have information about these events provided to them at their level of understanding and their choices respected such as whether or not they want to attend a funeral service by having the involvement of family and friends in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual being mindful of the double taboo of death and disability it helps individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders to process understand and feel included however if those supporting the individual are not properly educated on how those with different neurodevelopmental profiles process understand and express grief their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are aware of the potential differences and ultimately may prove harmful in areas beyond practical support furthermore the importance of the family unit is very crucial in a socio cognitive approach to bereavement counseling in this approach the neurodivergent individual has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling and mirroring behavior this approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are acceptable valid and normal in animals previously it was believed that grief was only a human emotion but studies have shown that other animals have shown grief or grief like states during the death of another animal most notably elephants wolves apes and goats this can occur between bonded animals which are animals that attempt to survive together i e a pack of wolves or mated prairie voles there is evidence that animals experience grief in the loss of their group member a mate or their owner for many days some animals show their grief for their loss for many years when animals are grieving their life routines change the same as humans for instance they may stop eating isolate themselves or change their sleeping routine by taking naps instead of sleeping during the night after the death of their group member or a mate some of the animals become depressed while others like the bonobo keep the dead bodies of their babies for a long time cats try to find their dead fellow with a mourning cry and dogs and horses become depressed since it is more difficult to study emotion in animals because of the lack of clear communication in effort to study grief research has been done on hormone levels one study found that females baboons showed significant increases in stress hormones called glucocorticoids the female baboons then increased grooming promoting physical touch which releases oxytocin which inhibits glucocorticoid release mammals mammals have demonstrated grief like states especially between a mother and her offspring she will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby s non response for example some deer will often sniff poke and look at its lifeless fawn before realizing it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards other animals such as a lioness will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it when a baby chimpanzee or gorilla dies the mother will carry the body around for several days before she may finally be able to move on without it this behavior has been observed in other primates as well the royal society suggests that such interactions have been proposed to be related to maternal condition attachment environmental conditions or reflect a lack of awareness that the infant has died jane goodall has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it and they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it one example of this goodall observed was of a chimpanzee mother of three who had died the siblings stayed by their mother s body the whole day of the three siblings the youngest showed the most agitation by screaming and became depressed but was able to recover by the care of the two older siblings however the youngest refused behavior from the siblings that were similar to the mother another notable example is koko a gorilla who was taught sign language who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat all ball elephants have shown unusual behavior upon encountering the remains of another deceased elephant they will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it for long periods of time until they must leave it behind it is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy or are just curious and investigating the dead body elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains when encountering the body of a deceased elephant or human elephants have been witnessed covering the body with vegetation and soil in what seems to be burial behavior an episode of the seminal bbc documentary series life on earth shows this in detail the elephants upon finding a dead herd member pause for several minutes at a time and carefully touch and hold the dead creature s bones birds some birds seem to lack the perception of grief or quickly accept it mallard hens although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked however some other waterbirds such as mute swans are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet and are known to engage in pining for days weeks or even months at a time other species of swans such as the black swan have also been observed mourning the loss of a close relative see also

"euphoria yoo for ee \u0259 is the experience or affect of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well being and happiness certain natural rewards and social activities such as aerobic exercise laughter listening to or making music and dancing can induce a state of euphoria euphoria is also a symptom of certain neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders such as mania romantic love and components of the human sexual response cycle are also associated with the induction of euphoria certain drugs many of which are addictive can cause euphoria which at least partially motivates their recreational use hedonic hotspots i e the pleasure centers of the brain are functionally linked activation of one hotspot results in the recruitment of the others inhibition of one hotspot results in the blunting of the effects of activating another hotspot therefore the simultaneous activation of every hedonic hotspot within the reward system is believed to be necessary for generating the sensation of an intense euphoria history the word euphoria is derived from the ancient greek terms \u03b5\u1f50\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u1f56 eu meaning well and \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 pher\u014d meaning to bear it is semantically opposite to dysphoria a 1706 english dictionary defines euphoria as the well bearing of the operation of a medicine i e when the patient finds himself eas d or reliev d by it during the 1860s the english physician thomas laycock described euphoria as the feeling of bodily well being and hopefulness he noted its misplaced presentation in the final stage of some terminal illnesses and attributed such euphoria to neurological dysfunction sigmund freud s 1884 monograph \u00fcber coca described his own consumption of cocaine producing the normal euphoria of a healthy person while about 1890 the german neuropsychiatrist carl wernicke lectured about the abnormal euphoria in patients with mania a 1903 article in the boston daily globe refers to euphoria as pleasant excitement and the sense of ease and well being in 1920 popular science magazine described euphoria as a high sounding name meaning feeling fit normally making life worth living motivating drug use and ill formed in certain mental illnesses robert s woodworth s 1921 textbook psychology a study of mental life describes euphoria as an organic state which is the opposite of fatigue and means about the same as feeling good in 1940 the journal of psychology defined euphoria as a state of general well being and pleasantly toned feeling a decade later finding ordinary feelings of well being difficult to evaluate american addiction researcher harris isbell redefined euphoria as behavioral changes and objective signs typical of morphine however in 1957 british pharmacologist d a cahal did not regard opioid euphoria as medically undesirable but an effect which enhance s the value of a major analgesic the 1977 edition of a concise encyclopaedia of psychiatry called euphoria a mood of contentment and well being with pathologic associations when used in a psychiatric context as a sign of cerebral disease it was described as bland and out of context representing an inability to experience negative emotion in the 21st century euphoria is generally defined as a state of great happiness well being and excitement which may be normal or abnormal and inappropriate when associated with psychoactive drugs manic states or brain disease or injury neuropsychology hedonic hotspots are functionally interrelated neural substrates structures that intrinsically or extrinsically generate the feelings of pleasure activation of one hedonic hotspot involves the stimulation of the others inhibition of one hedonic hotspot blunts the activation the other ones therefore the simultaneous activation of every hedonic hotspot within the reward system is probably necessary for generating the sensation of euphoria types many different types of stimuli can induce euphoria including psychoactive drugs natural rewards and social activities affective disorders such as unipolar mania or bipolar disorder can involve euphoria as a symptom exercise induced music induced euphoria can occur as a result of dancing to music music making and listening to emotionally arousing music neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the reward system plays a central role in mediating music induced pleasure pleasurable emotionally arousing music strongly increases dopamine neurotransmission in the dopaminergic pathways that project to the striatum i e the mesolimbic pathway and nigrostriatal pathway approximately 5 of the population experiences a phenomenon termed musical anhedonia in which individuals do not experience pleasure from listening to emotionally arousing music despite having the ability to perceive the intended emotion that is conveyed in passages of music a clinical study from january 2019 that assessed the effect of a dopamine precursor levodopa dopamine antagonist risperidone and a placebo on reward responses to music including the degree of pleasure experienced during musical chills as measured by changes in electrodermal activity as well as subjective ratings found that the manipulation of dopamine neurotransmission bidirectionally regulates pleasure cognition specifically the hedonic impact of music in human subjects this research suggests that increased dopamine neurotransmission acts as a sine qua non condition for pleasurable hedonic reactions to music in humans sex induced the various stages of copulation may also be described as inducing euphoria in some people various analysts have described either the entire sexual act the moments leading to orgasm or the orgasm itself as the pinnacle of human pleasure or euphoria drug induced a euphoriant is a type of psychoactive drug which tends to induce euphoria most euphoriants are addictive drugs due to their reinforcing properties and ability to activate the brain s reward system stimulants dopaminergic stimulants like amphetamine methamphetamine cocaine mdma and methylphenidate are euphoriants nicotine is a parasympathetic stimulant that acts as a mild euphoriant in some people xanthines such as caffeine and theobromine may also be considered mild euphoriants by some chewing areca nut seeds from the areca catechu palm with slaked lime calcium hydroxide a common practice in south and southeast asia produces stimulant effects and euphoria the major psychoactive ingredients arecoline a muscarinic receptor partial agonist and arecaidine a gaba reuptake inhibitor are responsible for the euphoric effect depressants certain depressants can produce euphoria some of those drugs in this class include alcohol in moderate doses \u03b3 hydroxybutyric acid ghb and ketamine some barbiturates and benzodiazepines may cause euphoria euphoriant effects are determined by the drug s speed of onset increasing dose and with intravenous administration barbiturates more likely to cause euphoria include amobarbital secobarbital and pentobarbital benzodiazepines more likely to cause euphoria are flunitrazepam alprazolam and clonazepam benzodiazepines also tend to enhance opioid induced euphoria pregabalin induces dose dependent euphoria occurring in a small percentage of individuals at recommended doses euphoria is increasingly frequent at supratherapeutic doses or with intravenous or nasal administration at doses five times the maximum recommended intense euphoria is reported another gaba analogue gabapentin may induce euphoria characterized as opioid like but less intense it may occur at supratherapeutic doses or in combination with other drugs such as opioids or alcohol ethosuximide and perampanel can also produce euphoria at therapeutic doses opioids \u03bc opioid receptor agonists are a set of euphoriants that include drugs such as heroin morphine codeine oxycodone and fentanyl by contrast \u03ba opioid receptor agonists like the endogenous neuropeptide dynorphin are known to cause dysphoria a mood state opposite to euphoria that involves feelings of profound discontent cannabinoids cannabinoid

considered neuropsychiatric mania euphoria is also strongly associated with both hypomania and mania mental states characterized by a pathological heightening of mood which may be either euphoric or irritable in addition to other symptoms such as pressured speech flight of ideas and grandiosity although hypomania and mania are syndromes with multiple etiologies that is ones that may arise from any number of conditions they are most commonly seen in bipolar disorder a psychiatric illness characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression epilepsy euphoria may occur during auras of seizures typically originating in the temporal lobe but affecting the anterior insular cortex this euphoria is symptomatic of a rare syndrome called ecstatic seizures often also involving mystical experiences euphoria or more commonly dysphoria may also occur in periods between epileptic seizures this condition interictal dysphoric disorder is considered an atypical affective disorder persons who experience feelings of depression or anxiety between or before seizures occasionally experience euphoria afterwards migraine some persons experience euphoria in the prodrome hours to days before the onset of a migraine headache similarly a euphoric state occurs in some persons following the migraine episode multiple sclerosis euphoria sometimes occurs in persons with multiple sclerosis as the illness progresses this euphoria is part of a syndrome originally called euphoria sclerotica which typically includes disinhibition and other symptoms of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction gender euphoria gender euphoria is satisfaction or enjoyment felt by a person due to consistency between their gender identity and gendered features associated with a gender different to the sex they were assigned at birth it is considered to be the positive counterpart of gender dysphoria related euphorias have also been recorded in studies of alignments between sexual identity and social recognition such as support in schools for lesbian and gay people and experiences of intersex variation and their diagnoses such as receiving a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia which explained physical differences for example see also peak experience references external links the dictionary definition of euphoria at wiktionary", "Regret": "regret is the emotion of wishing one had made a different decision in the past because the consequences of the decision one did make were unfavorable regret is related to perceived opportunity its intensity varies over time after the decision in regard to action versus inaction and in regard to self control at a particular age the self recrimination which comes with regret is thought to spur corrective action and adaptation in western societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education definition regret has been defined by psychologists in the late 1990s as a negative emotion predicated on an upward self focused counterfactual inference another definition is an aversive emotional state elicited by a discrepancy in the outcome values of chosen vs unchosen actions regret differs from remorse in that people can regret things beyond their control but remorse indicates a sense of responsibility for the situation for example a person can feel regret that people die during natural disasters but cannot feel remorse for that situation however a person who intentionally harms someone should feel remorse for those actions agent regret is the idea that a person could be involved in a situation and regret their involvement even if those actions were innocent unintentional or involuntary for example if someone decides to die by stepping in front of a moving vehicle the death is not the fault of the driver but the driver may still regret that the person died regret is distinct from disappointment both are negative emotional experiences relating to a loss outcome and both have similar neuronal correlates however they differ in regard to feedback about the outcome comparing the difference between outcomes for the chosen vs unchosen action in regret full feedback occurs and with disappointment partial feedback they also differ in regard to agency self in regret versus external in disappointment models there are conceptual models of regret in regret decision theory mostly in theoretical economics and finance under a field called behavioral economics anticipated regret or how much regret one thinks one will feel in the future appears to be overestimated for actions and choices this appears to be in part due to a tendency to underestimate the extent to which people attribute bad outcomes to external factors rather than to internal factors i e themselves it can lead to inaction or inertia and omission bias existential regret has been specifically defined as a profound desire to go back and change a past experience in which one has failed to choose consciously or has made a choice that did not follow one s beliefs values or growth needs instruments to measure regret in people having to make medical decisions have failed to address current concepts of regret and failed to differentiate regret from disappointment they have also not looked for positive impacts of regret process regret may occur if a person does not consider information about all available choices before making a decision people will go out of their way to avoid regret which is called regret aversion this can aid in the decisions one will make however many will go to extreme measures to avoid having to feel regret in the book thinking fast and slow by daniel kahneman many topics relate to regret system one and system two thinking are systems in the mind that explain different ways people think system one thinking is quicker and involves less effort of the mind while system two thinking is slower and involves more effort of the mind in both these systems the desire to avoid regret and other negative feelings can be seen in the way decisions are made and the way people think loss aversion is a part of regret and regret aversion due to the way people put in the effort to not lose something it is believed that losing something has a stronger emotional pull than gaining something does however this may not always be true in 2020 a study published by three people in the department of psychology at king s college london researched loss aversion and how it might affect making decisions the study suggests that depending on the circumstances and experiences loss aversion could be inaccurate life domains a 2005 meta analysis of 9 studies 7 us one germany one finland about what adults regret most concluded that overall adults regret choices regarding their education the most subsequent rankings included decisions about career romance and parenting education has been the forerunner of regret in the u s per gallup surveys in 1949 1953 and 1965 education was the forerunner of regret because it is seen as something where circumstances could be changed in contemporary society education is open to continual modification throughout life with the rise of community colleges and student aid programs in recent decades education of some sort is accessible to nearly all socioeconomic groups this finding can be attributed to the principle of perceived opportunity people s biggest regrets are a reflection of where in life they see their largest opportunities that is where they see tangible prospects for change growth and renewal in other cultures regrets may be ranked differently depending on the perceived opportunity in a particular society in health care decisions a 2016 review of past studies found risk factors for people to develop decision regret regarding their health care were higher decisional conflict lower satisfaction with the decision adverse outcomes in physical health and greater anxiety levels deathbed regrets a 2018 study found that people were more likely to express ideal related regrets such as failing to follow their dreams and live up to their full potential this was found to correlate with the anecdotal accounts of palliative care nurse bronnie ware about the most common regrets she had heard expressed by those nearing death which included i wish i d had the courage to live a life true to myself not the life others expected of me i wish i hadn t worked so hard i wish i d had the courage to express my feelings i wish i had stayed in touch with my friends i wish that i had let myself be happier determinants of intensity action versus inaction there is an interplay between action versus inaction and time regrets of an action are more intense in the short term whereas regrets of inaction are more intense over the long term age in a 2001 study high intensity of regret and intrusive thoughts in older adults was related to self control and low internal control was expected to be self protective and help to decrease regret in younger adults internal control facilitated active change and was associated with low intensity of regret opportunity people s biggest regrets occur where they perceive the greatest and most important opportunity for corrective action when no opportunity exists to improve conditions thought processes mitigate the cognitive dissonance caused by regret e g by rationalization and reconstrual regret pushes people toward revised decision making and corrective action as part of learning that may bring improvement in life circumstances a 1999 study measured regret in accordance to negative reviews with service providers regret was an accurate predictor of who switched providers as more intense regret is experienced the likelihood of initiating change is increased consequently the more opportunity of corrective action available the larger the regret felt and the more likely corrective action is achieved feeling regret spurs future action to make sure other opportunities are taken so that regret will not be experienced again people learn from their mistakes lost opportunity principle with a lost opportunity regret should intensify not diminish when people feel that they could have made better choices in the past but now perceive limited opportunities to take corrective action in the future people who habitually consider future consequences and how they may avoid future negative outcomes experience less rather than more intense regret after a negative outcome this principle offers another reason as to why education is the most regretted aspect in life education becomes a more limited opportunity as time passes aspects such as making friends becoming more spiritual and community involvement tend to be less regrettable which makes sense because these are also aspects in life that do not become limited opportunities as the opportunity to remedy a situation passes feelings of hopelessness may increase an explanation of the lost opportunity principle can be seen as a lack of closure low closure makes past occurrences feel unresolved low closure is associated with reductions in self esteem and persistent negative affect over time and with the realization and regret of lost opportunity high closure is associated with acceptance of lost opportunity the lost opportunity principle suggests that regret does not serve as a corrective motive which the opportunity principle suggests instead regret serves as a more general reminder to seize the day regret lingers where opportunity existed with the self blame of remorse being a core element to ultimately spur corrective action in decision making neuroscience research upon brain injury and fmri have linked the orbitofrontal cortex to the processing of regret completeness of feedback about the outcomes after making a decision determined whether persons experienced regret outcomes from both the choice and the alternative vs disappointment partial feedback seeing only the outcome from the choice in a magnetoencephalography study another factor was the type of agency with personal decision making the neural correlates of regret could be seen with external agency computer choice those of disappointment feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region both regret and disappointment activated anterior insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex but only with regret the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was activated psychopathic individuals do not show regret or remorse this was thought to be due to an inability to generate this emotion in response to negative outcomes however in 2016 people with antisocial personality disorder also known as dissocial personality disorder were found to experience regret but did not use the regret to guide their choice in behavior there was no lack of regret but a problem to think through a range of potential actions and estimating the outcome values in other species a study published in 2014 by neuroscientists based at the university of minnesota suggested that rats are capable of feeling regret about their actions this emotion had never previously been found in any other mammals apart from humans researchers set up situations to induce regret and rats expressed regret through both their behavior and specific neural patterns in brain activity in 2013 a study published by two people in the department of evolutionary anthropology at duke university analyzed the relationship between decisions and outcomes with emotional reactions in the actions of primates such as chimpanzees and bonobos the findings were that bonobos were more likely to try to change their decision after an outcome had been undesirable and less likely to decide on a risky option the outcomes would affect their next decision chimpanzees were found to not change their reaction to an outcome even after a decision had led to something undesirable this has led the researchers to believe that some primates including bonobos and chimpanzees are more susceptible to feelings of regret that can cause them to alter their display in certain behaviors see also regret decision theory apology loss aversion thinking fast and slow daniel kahneman emotion references", "Loneliness": "loneliness is an unpleasant emotional response to perceived isolation loneliness is also described as social pain a psychological mechanism that motivates individuals to seek social connections it is often associated with a perceived lack of connection and intimacy loneliness overlaps and yet is distinct from solitude solitude is simply the state of being apart from others not everyone who experiences solitude feels lonely as a subjective emotion loneliness can be felt even when a person is surrounded by other people the causes of loneliness are varied loneliness can be a result of genetic inheritance cultural factors a lack of meaningful relationships a significant loss an excessive reliance on passive technologies notably the internet in the 21st century or a self perpetuating mindset research has shown that loneliness is found throughout society including among people in marriages along with other strong relationships and those with successful careers most people experience loneliness at some points in their lives and some feel it often loneliness is found to be the highest among younger people as according to the bbc loneliness experiment 40 people within the age group 16 24 admit to feeling lonely while the percentage of people who feel lonely above age 75 is around 27 the effects of loneliness are also varied transient loneliness loneliness that exists for a short period of time is related to positive effects including an increased focus on the strength of one s relationships chronic loneliness loneliness that exists for a significant amount of time in one s life is generally correlated with negative effects including increased obesity substance use disorder risk of depression cardiovascular disease risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol chronic loneliness is also correlated with an increased risk of death and suicidal thoughts medical treatments for loneliness include beginning therapy and taking antidepressants social treatments for loneliness generally include an increase in interaction with others such as group activities such as exercise or religious activities re engaging with old friends or colleagues owning pets and becoming more connected with one s community loneliness has long been a theme in literature going back to the epic of gilgamesh however academic coverage of loneliness was sparse until recent decades in the 21st century some academics and professionals have claimed that loneliness has become an epidemic including vivek murthy the surgeon general of the united states causes existential loneliness has long been viewed as a universal condition which at least to a moderate extent is felt by everyone from this perspective some degree of loneliness is inevitable as the limitations of human life mean it is impossible for anyone to continually satisfy their inherent need for connection professors including michele a carter and ben lazare mijuskovic have written books and essays tracking the existential perspective and the many writers who have talked about it throughout history thomas wolfe s 1930s essay god s lonely man is frequently discussed in this regard wolfe makes the case that everyone imagines they are lonely in a special way unique to themselves whereas really every single person sometimes experiences loneliness while agreeing that loneliness alleviation can be a good thing those who take the existential view tend to doubt such efforts can ever be fully successful seeing some level of loneliness as both unavoidable and even beneficial as it can help people appreciate the joy of living cultural culture is discussed as a cause of loneliness in two senses migrants can experience loneliness due to missing their home culture studies have found this effect can be especially strong for students from countries in asia with a collective culture when they go to study at universities in more individualist english speaking countries culture is also seen as a cause of loneliness in the sense that western culture may have been contributing to loneliness ever since the enlightenment began to favour individualism over older communal values lack of meaningful relationships for many people the family of origin did not offer the trust building relationships needed to build a reference that lasts a lifetime and even in memory after the passing of a loved one this can be due to parenting style traditions mental health issues including personality disorders and abusive family environments sometimes religious shunning is also present this impacts the ability of individuals to know themselves to value themselves and to relate to others or to do so with great difficulty all these factors and many others are often overlooked by the standard medical or psychological advice that recommends to go meet friends family and to socialise this is not always possible when there is no one available to relate to and an inability to connect without the skills and knowledge on how to proceed with time a person might become discouraged or develop apathy from numerous trials failures or rejections brought on by the lack of interpersonal skills as the rate of loneliness increases yearly among people of every age group and more so in the elderly with known detrimental physical and psychological effects there is a need to find new ways to connect people with each other and especially so at a time when a whole lot of the human attention is focused on electronic devices it is a challenge relationship loss loneliness is a very common though often temporary consequence of a relationship breakup or bereavement the loss of a significant person in one s life will typically initiate a grief response in this situation one might feel lonely even while in the company of others loneliness can occur due to the disruption to one s social circle sometimes combined with homesickness which results from people moving away for work or education situational all sorts of situations and events can cause loneliness especially in combination with certain personality traits for susceptible individuals for example an extroverted person who is highly social is more likely to feel lonely if they are living somewhere with a low population density with fewer people for them to interact with loneliness can sometimes even be caused by events that might normally be expected to alleviate it for example the birth of a child if there is significant postpartum depression or after getting married especially if the marriage turns out to be unstable overly disruptive to previous relationships or emotionally cold in addition to being impacted by external events loneliness can be aggravated by pre existing mental health conditions like chronic depression and anxiety self perpetuating long term loneliness can cause various types of maladaptive social cognition such as hypervigilance and social awkwardness which can make it harder for an individual to maintain existing relationships or establish new ones various studies have found that therapy targeted at addressing this maladaptive cognition is the single most effective way of intervening to reduce loneliness though it does not always work for everyone social contagion loneliness can spread through social groups like a disease the mechanism for this involves the maladaptive cognition that often results from chronic loneliness if a man loses a friend for whatever reason this may increase his loneliness resulting in him developing maladaptive cognition such as excessive neediness or suspicion of other friends hence leading to a further loss of human connection if he then goes on to split up with his remaining friends those other friends now become lonelier too leading to a ripple effect of loneliness studies have however found that this contagion effect is not consistent a small increase in loneliness does not always cause the maladaptive cognition also when someone loses a friend they will sometimes form new friendships or deepen other existing relationships internet studies have tended to find a moderate correlation between extensive internet use and loneliness especially ones that draw on data from the 1990s before internet use became widespread contradictory results have been found by studies investigating whether the association is simply a result of lonely people being more attracted to the internet or if the internet can actually cause loneliness the displacement hypothesis holds that some people choose to withdraw from real world social interactions so they can have more time for the internet excessive internet use can directly cause anxiety and depression conditions which can contribute to loneliness yet these factors may be offset by the internet s ability to facilitate interaction and to empower people some studies found that internet use is a cause of loneliness at least for some types of people others have found internet use can have a significant positive effect on reducing loneliness the authors of meta studies and reviews from about 2015 and later have tended to argue that there is a bidirectional causal relationship between loneliness and internet use excessive use especially if passive can increase loneliness while moderate use especially by users who engage with others rather than just passively consume content can increase social connection and reduce loneliness genetics smaller early studies had estimated that loneliness may be between 37 55 hereditable however in 2016 the first genome wide association study of loneliness found that the heredity of loneliness is much lower at about 14 27 this suggests that while genes play a role in determining how much loneliness a person may feel they are less of a factor than individual experiences and the environment ageing loneliness peaks in adolescence and late adulthood while being less common in middle adulthood other people making long driving commutes have reported dramatically higher feelings of loneliness as well as other negative health impacts typology two principal types of loneliness are social and emotional loneliness this delineation was made in 1973 by robert s weiss in his seminal work loneliness the experience of emotional and social isolation based on weiss s view that both types of loneliness have to be examined independently because the satisfaction for the need of emotional loneliness cannot act as a counterbalance for social loneliness and vice versa people working to treat or better understand loneliness have tended to treat these two types of loneliness separately though this is far from always the case social loneliness social loneliness is the loneliness people experience because of the lack of a wider social network they may not feel they are members of a community or that they have friends or allies whom they can rely on in times of distress emotional loneliness emotional loneliness results from the lack of deep nurturing relationships with other people weiss tied his concept of emotional loneliness to attachment theory people have a need for deep attachments which can be fulfilled by close friends though more often by close family members such as parents and later in life by romantic partners in 1997 enrico ditommaso and barry spinner separated emotional loneliness into romantic and family loneliness a 2019 study found that emotional loneliness significantly increased the likelihood of death for older adults living alone whereas there was no increase in mortality found with social loneliness family loneliness family loneliness results when individuals feel they lack close ties with family members a 2010 study of 1 009 students found that only family loneliness was associated with increased frequency of self harm not romantic or social loneliness romantic loneliness romantic loneliness can be experienced by adolescents and adults who lack a close bond with a romantic partner psychologists have asserted that the formation of a committed romantic relationship is a critical development task for young adults but is also one that many are delaying into their late 20s or beyond people in romantic relationships tend to report less loneliness than single people provided their relationship provides them with emotional intimacy people in unstable or emotionally cold romantic partnerships can still feel romantic loneliness other several other typologies and types of loneliness exist further types of loneliness include existential loneliness cosmic loneliness feeling alone in a hostile universe and cultural loneliness typically found among immigrants who miss their home culture these types are less well studied than the threefold separation into social romantic and family loneliness yet can be valuable in understanding the experience of certain subgroups with loneliness lockdown loneliness lockdown loneliness refers to loneliness resulting because of social disconnection due to enforced social distancing and lockdowns during the covid 19 pandemic and similar emergency situations demarcation differences between feeling lonely and being socially isolated there is a clear distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated for example a loner in particular one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one s necessary and achieved levels of social interaction while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people loneliness is therefore a subjective yet multidimensional experience if a person thinks they are lonely then they are lonely people can be lonely while in solitude or in the middle of a crowd what makes a person lonely is their perceived need for more social interaction or a certain type or quality of social interaction that is not currently available a person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people conversely one can be alone and not feel lonely even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction there have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction if a person gets too little or too much social interaction this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over stimulation solitude can have positive effects on individuals one study found that although time spent alone tended to depress a person s mood and increase feelings of loneliness it also helped to improve their cognitive state such as improving concentration it can be argued some individuals seek solitude for discovering a more meaningful and vital existence furthermore once the alone time was over people s moods tended to increase significantly solitude is also associated with other positive growth experiences religious experiences and identity building such as solitary quests used in rites of passages for adolescents transient vs chronic loneliness another important typology of loneliness focuses on the time perspective in this respect loneliness can be viewed as either transient or chronic transient loneliness is temporary in nature generally it is easily relieved chronic loneliness is more permanent and not easily relieved for example when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends this would be a case of transient loneliness once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness a person with long term feelings of loneliness regardless of if they are at a family gathering or with friends is experiencing chronic loneliness loneliness as a human condition the existentialist school of thought views individuality as the essence of being human each human being comes into the world alone travels through life as a separate person and ultimately dies alone coping with this accepting it and learning how to direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the human condition some philosophers such as sartre believe in an epistemic loneliness in which loneliness is a fundamental part of the human condition because of the paradox between people s consciousness desiring meaning in life and the isolation and nothingness of the universe conversely other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process in his 2019 text evidence of being the black gay cultural renaissance and the politics of violence darius bost draws from heather love s theorization of loneliness to delineate the ways in which loneliness structures black gay feeling and literary cultural productions bost writes as a form of negative affect loneliness shores up the alienation isolation and pathologization of black gay men during the 1980s and early 1990s but loneliness is also a form of bodily desire a yearning for an attachment to the social and for a future beyond the forces that create someone s alienation and isolation prevalence possibly over 5 of the population of the industrial countries experience loneliness at levels which are harmful to physical and mental health though scientists have expressed caution over making such claims with high confidence thousands of studies and surveys have been undertaken to assess the prevalence of loneliness yet it remains challenging for scientists to make accurate generalisations and comparisons reasons for this include various loneliness measurement scales being used by different studies differences in how even the same scale is implemented from study to study and as cultural variations across time and space may impact how people report the largely subjective phenomena of loneliness one consistent finding has been that loneliness is not evenly distributed across a nation s population it tends to be concentrated among vulnerable sub groups for example the poor the unemployed immigrants and mothers some of the most severe loneliness tends to be found among international students from countries in asia with a collective culture when they come to study in countries with a more individualist culture such as australia in new zealand the fourteen surveyed groups with the highest prevalence of loneliness most all of the time in descending order are disabled people recent migrants low income households unemployed single parents rural rest of south island seniors aged 75 not in the labour force youth aged 15 24 no qualifications not housing owner occupier not in a family nucleus m\u0101ori and low personal income studies have found inconsistent results concerning the effect of age gender and culture on loneliness much 20th century and early 21st century writing on loneliness assumed it typically increases with age in high income countries on average one in four people over 60 and one in three over 75 feels lonely yet as of 2020 with some exceptions recent studies have tended to find that it is young people who report the most loneliness though loneliness is still found to be a severe problem for the very old there have been contradictory results concerning how the prevalence of loneliness varies with gender a 2020 analysis based on a worldwide dataset gathered by the bbc found greater loneliness among men though some earlier work had found the opposite or that gender made no difference while cross cultural comparisons are difficult to interpret with high confidence the 2020 analyses based on the bbc dataset found the more individualist countries like the uk tended to have higher levels of loneliness however previous empirical work had often found that people living in more collectivist cultures tended to report greater loneliness possibly due to less freedom to choose the sort of relationships that suit them best increasing prevalence in the 21st century loneliness has been widely reported as an increasing worldwide problem a 2010 systematic review and meta analyses had stated that the modern way of life in industrialized countries is greatly reducing the quality of social relationships partly due to people no longer living in close proximity with their extended families the review notes that from 1990 to 2010 the number of americans reporting no close confidants has tripled in 2017 vivek murthy the surgeon general of the united states argued that there was a loneliness epidemic it has since been described as an epidemic thousands of times by reporters academics and other public officials professors such as claude s fischer and eric klinenberg opined in 2018 that while the data doesn t support describing loneliness as an epidemic or even as a clearly growing problem loneliness is indeed a serious issue having a severe health impact on millions of people however a 2021 study found that adolescent loneliness in contemporary schools and depression increased substantially and consistently worldwide after 2012 a comparative overview of the prevalence and determinants of loneliness and social isolation in europe in the pre covid period was conducted by joint research centre of the european commission within the project loneliness in europe the empirical results indicate that 8 6 of the adult population in europe experience frequent loneliness and 20 8 experience social isolation with eastern europe recording the highest prevalence of both phenomena in australia the annual national household income and labour dynamics in australia hilda survey has reported a steady 8 rise in agreement with the statement i often feel very lonely between 2009 and 2021 responses indicating strongly agree rose steadily by over 20 in that same time period this is a reversal of the trend seen from the start of the survey in 2001 until 2009 where these figures had both been steadily decreasing loneliness was exacerbated by the isolating effects of social distancing stay at home orders and deaths during the covid 19 pandemic in may 2023 murthy published a united states department of health and human services advisory on the impact of the epidemic of loneliness and isolation in the united states the report likened the dangers of loneliness to other public health threats such as smoking and obesity in november 2023 the world health organization declared loneliness a global public health concern and launched an international commission to study the problem effects transient while unpleasant temporary feelings of loneliness are sometimes experienced by almost everyone they are not thought to cause long term harm early 20th century work sometimes treated loneliness as a wholly negative phenomenon yet transient loneliness is now generally considered beneficial the capacity to feel it may have been evolutionarily selected for a healthy aversive emotion that motivates individuals to strengthen social connections transient loneliness is sometimes compared to short term hunger which is unpleasant but ultimately useful as it motivates us to eat chronic long term loneliness is widely considered a close to entirely harmful condition whereas transient loneliness typically motivates us to improve relationships with others chronic loneliness can have the opposite effect this is as long term social isolation can cause hypervigilance while enhanced vigilance may have been evolutionary adaptive for individuals who went long periods without others watching their backs it can lead to excessive cynicism and suspicion of other people which in turn can be detrimental to interpersonal relationships so without intervention chronic loneliness can be self reinforcing benefits much has been written about the benefits of being alone yet often even when authors use the word loneliness they are referring to what could be more precisely described as voluntary solitude yet some assert that even long term involuntary loneliness can have beneficial effects chronic loneliness is often seen as a purely negative phenomena from the lens of social and medical science yet in spiritual and artistic traditions it has been viewed as having mixed effects though even within these traditions there can be warnings not to intentionally seek out chronic loneliness or other conditions just advise that if one falls into them there can be benefits in western arts there is a long belief that psychological hardship including loneliness can be a source of creativity in spiritual traditions perhaps the most obvious benefit of loneliness is that it can increase the desire for a union with the divine more esoterically the psychic wound opened up by loneliness or other conditions has been said e g by simone weil to open up space for god to manifest within the soul in christianity spiritual dryness has been seen as advantageous as part of the dark night of the soul an ordeal that while painful can result in spiritual transformation from a secular perspective while the vast majority of empirical studies focus on the negative effects of long term loneliness a few studies have found there can also be benefits such as enhanced perceptiveness of social situations brain studies have found mostly negative effects from chronic loneliness on brain functioning and structure however certain parts of the brain and specific functions like the ability to detect social threat appear to be strengthened a 2020 population genetics study looked for signatures of loneliness in grey matter morphology intrinsic functional coupling and fiber tract microstructure the loneliness linked neurobiological profiles converged on a collection of brain regions known as the default mode network this higher associative network shows more consistent loneliness associations in grey matter volume than other cortical brain networks lonely individuals display stronger functional communication in the default network and greater microstructural integrity of its fornix pathway the findings fit with the possibility that the up regulation of these neural circuits supports mentalizing reminiscence and imagination to fill the social void physical health chronic loneliness can be a serious life threatening health condition it has been found to be strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease though direct causal links have yet to be firmly identified people experiencing loneliness tend to have an increased incidence of high blood pressure high cholesterol and obesity loneliness has been shown to increase the concentration of cortisol levels in the body and weaken the effects of dopamine the hormone that makes people enjoy things prolonged high cortisol levels can cause anxiety depression digestive problems heart disease sleep problems and weight gain associational studies on loneliness and the immune system have found mixed results with lower natural killer nk cell activity or dampened antibody response to viruses such epstein barr herpes and influenza but either slower or no change to the progression of aids based on the elsa a study found that loneliness increased the risk of dementia by one third not having a partner being single divorced or widowed doubled the risk of dementia however having two or three closer relationships reduced the risk by three fifths and based on the large uk biobank cohort a study found that individuals who reported feeling lonely had a higher risk of developing parkinson s disease death a 2010 systematic review and meta analyses found a significant association between loneliness and increased mortality people with good social relationships were found to have a 50 greater chance of survival compared to lonely people odds ratio 1 5 in other words chronic loneliness seems to be a risk factor for death comparable to smoking and greater than obesity or lack of exercise a 2017 overview of systematic reviews found other meta studies with similar findings however clear causative links between loneliness and early death have not been firmly established mental health loneliness has been linked with depression and is thus a risk factor for suicide a study based on more than 4 000 adults aged over 50 in the english longitudinal study of ageing elsa looked at loneliness nearly one in five of those who reported being lonely had developed signs of depression within a year \u00e9mile durkheim has described loneliness specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others i e for friendships or altruistic ideas as the main reason for what he called egoistic suicide in adults loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and alcoholism people who are socially isolated may report poor sleep quality and thus have diminished restorative processes loneliness has also been linked with a schizoid character type in which one may see the world differently and experience social alienation described as the self in exile while the long term effects of extended periods of loneliness are little understood it has been noted that people who are isolated or experience loneliness for a long period of time fall into a ontological crisis or ontological insecurity where they are not sure if they or their surroundings exist and if they do exactly who or what they are creating torment suffering and despair to the point of palpability within the thoughts of the person in children a lack of social connections is directly linked to several forms of antisocial and self destructive behavior most notably hostile and delinquent behavior in both children and adults loneliness often has a negative impact on learning and memory its disruption of sleep patterns can have a significant impact on the ability to function in everyday life research from a large scale study published in the journal psychological medicine showed that lonely millennials are more likely to have mental health problems be out of work and feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than their peers who feel connected to others regardless of gender or wealth in 2004 the united states department of justice published a study indicating that loneliness increases suicide rates profoundly among juveniles with 62 of all suicides that occurred within juvenile facilities being among those who either were at the time of the suicide in solitary confinement or among those with a history of being housed thereof pain depression and fatigue function as a symptom cluster and thus may share common risk factors two longitudinal studies with different populations demonstrated that loneliness was a risk factor for the development of the pain depression and fatigue symptom cluster over time these data also highlight the health risks of loneliness pain depression and fatigue often accompany serious illness and place people at risk for poor health and mortality the psychiatrist george vaillant and the director of longitudinal study of adult development at harvard university robert j waldinger found that those who were happiest and healthier reported strong interpersonal relationships suicide loneliness can cause suicidal thoughts suicidal ideation attempts at suicide and actual suicide the extent to which suicides result from loneliness are difficult to determine however as there are typically several potential causes involved in an article written for the american foundation for suicide prevention dr jeremy noble writes you don t have to be a doctor to recognize the connection between loneliness and suicide as feelings of loneliness intensify so do thoughts of suicide and attempts at suicide the loneliness that triggers suicidal tendencies impacts all facets of society the samaritans a nonprofit charity in england who work with people going through crisis says there is a definite correlation between feelings of loneliness and suicide for juveniles and those in their young adult years the office of national statistics in england found one of the top ten reasons young people have suicidal idealizations and attempt suicide is because they are lonely college students lonely away from home living in new unfamiliar surroundings away from friends feel isolated and without proper coping skills will turn to suicide as a way to fix the pain of loneliness a common theme among children and young adults dealing with feelings of loneliness is they didn t know help was available or where to get help loneliness to them is a source of shame older people can also struggle with feelings of severe loneliness which lead them to consider acting on thoughts of suicide or self harm in some countries senior citizens appear to commit a high proportion of suicides though in other countries there is a significantly higher rate for middle aged men retirement poor health loss of a significant other or other family or friends all contribute to loneliness suicides caused by loneliness in older people can be difficult to identify often they don t have anyone to disclose their feelings of loneliness and the despair it brings they may stop eating alter the doses of medications or choose not to treat an illness as a way to help expedite death so they don t have to deal with feeling lonely cultural influences can also cause loneliness leading to suicidal thoughts or actions for example hispanic and japanese cultures value interdependence when a person from one of these cultures feels removed or feels like they can t sustain relationships in their families or society they start to have negative behaviors including negative thoughts or acting self destructively other cultures such as in europe are more independent while the cause of loneliness in a person may stem from different circumstances or cultural norms the impact lead to the same results a desire to end life society level high levels of chronic loneliness can also have society wide effects noreena hertz writes that hannah arendt was the first to discuss the link between loneliness and the politics of intolerance in her book the origins of totalitarianism arendt argues that loneliness is an essential prerequisite for a totalitarian movement to gain power hertz states that the link between an individual s loneliness and their likelihood to vote for a populist political party or candidate has since been supported by several empirical studies in addition to increasing support for populist policies hertz argues that a society with high levels of loneliness risks eroding its ability to have effective mutually beneficial politics partly as loneliness tends to make people more suspicious about each other and also as some of the ways individuals alleviate loneliness such as technological or transactional substitutes for human companionship can reduce peoples political and social skills such as their ability to compromise and to see other points of view however the link between loneliness and political attitudes remains underexplored and ambiguous studies investigating the relationship between loneliness and voter orientation directly found that lonely individuals tend to abstain from elections rather than support populist parties this inconsistency might stem from differences in the definition and operationalization of loneliness while hertz applies a broader definition of loneliness the empirical studies that contradict her point use self reported directly measured loneliness as predictor for voting behavior physiological mechanisms linked to poor health there are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes in 2005 results from the american framingham heart study demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of interleukin 6 il 6 a blood chemical linked to heart disease a 2006 study conducted by the center for cognitive and social neuroscience at the university of chicago found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty another finding from a survey conducted by john cacioppo from the university of chicago is that doctors report providing better medical care to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone cacioppo states that loneliness impairs cognition and willpower alters dna transcription in immune cells and leads over time to high blood pressure lonelier people are more likely to show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people inflammation is a well known risk factor for age related diseases when someone feels left out of a situation they feel excluded and one possible side effect is for their body temperature to decrease when people feel excluded blood vessels at the periphery of the body may narrow preserving core body heat this class protective mechanism is known as vasoconstriction relief the reduction of loneliness in oneself and others has long been a motive for human activity and social organization for some commentators such as professor ben lazare mijuskovic ever since the dawn of civilization it has been the single strongest motivator for human activity after essential physical needs are satisfied loneliness is the first negative condition identified in the bible with the book of genesis showing god creating a companion for man to relieve loneliness nevertheless there is relatively little direct record of explicit loneliness relief efforts prior to the 20th century some commentators including professor rubin gotesky have argued the sense of aloneness was rarely felt until older communal ways of living began to be disrupted by the enlightenment starting in the 1900s and especially in the 21st century efforts explicitly aiming to alleviate loneliness became much more common loneliness reduction efforts occur across multiple disciplines often by actors for whom loneliness relief is not their primary concern for example by commercial firms civic planners designers of new housing developments and university administration across the world many departments ngos and even umbrella groups entirely dedicated to loneliness relief have been established for example in the uk the campaign to end loneliness with loneliness being a complex condition there is no single method that can consistently alleviate it for different individuals many different approaches are used medical treatment therapy is a common way of treating loneliness for individuals whose loneliness is caused by factors that respond well to medical intervention it is often successful short term therapy the most common form for lonely or depressed patients typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks during therapy emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem reversing the negative thoughts feelings and attitudes resulting from the problem and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other patients and establish a support system doctors also frequently prescribe anti depressants to patients as a stand alone treatment or in conjunction with therapy it may take several attempts before a suitable anti depressant medication is found doctors often see a high proportion of patients with loneliness a uk survey found that three quarters of doctors believed that between 1 5 patients visited them each day mainly out of loneliness there isn t always sufficient funds to pay for therapy leading to the rise of social prescription where doctors can refer patients to ngo and community led solutions such as group activities while preliminary findings suggest social prescription has good results for some people early evidence to support its effectiveness was not strong with commentators advising that for some people it is not a good alternative to medical therapy as of 2024 formal social prescribing programmes have been launched in 17 different countries around the world with improved evidence for its effectiveness when the prescriptions are carefully targeted such as helping the lonely person get closer to nature or participate in group activities they enjoy ngo and community led along with growing awareness of the problem of loneliness community led projects explicitly aiming for its relief became more common in the latter half of the 20th century with still more starting up in the 21st there have been many thousands of such projects across north and south america europe asia and africa some campaigns are run nationally under the control of charities dedicated to loneliness relief while other efforts may be local projects sometimes run by a group for which loneliness relief is not their primary objective for example housing associations that aim to ensure multi generational living with social interaction between younger and older people encouraged in some cases even contractually required projects range from befriending schemes that facilitate just two people meeting up to large group activities which will often have other objectives in addition to loneliness relief as having fun improving physical health with exercise or participating in conservation efforts for example in new zealand the ngo age concern began an accredited visiting service which was found to be an effective counter to this loneliness and isolation government in 2010 fran\u00e7ois fillon announced the fight against loneliness would be france s great national cause for 2011 in the uk the jo cox commission on loneliness began pushing to make tackling loneliness a government priority from 2016 in 2018 this led to great britain becoming the first country in the world to appoint a ministerial lead for loneliness and to publish an official loneliness reduction strategy there have since been calls for other countries to appoint their own minister for loneliness for example in sweden and germany various other countries had seen government led anti loneliness efforts even before 2018 however for example in 2017 the government of singapore started a scheme to provide allotments to its citizens so they could socialise while working together on them while the netherlands government set up a telephone line for lonely older people while governments sometimes directly control loneliness relief efforts typically they fund or work in partnership with educational institutions companies and ngos pets pet therapy or animal assisted therapy can be used to treat both loneliness and depression the presence of animal companions especially dogs but also others like cats rabbits and guinea pigs can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some patients beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners according to the centers for disease control and prevention there are a number of other health benefits associated with pet ownership including lowered blood pressure and decreased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides technology technology companies have been advertising their products as helpful for reducing loneliness at least as far back as 1905 records exist of early telephones being presented as a way for isolated farmers to reduce loneliness technological solutions for loneliness have been suggested much more frequently since the development of the internet and especially since loneliness became a more prominent public health issue at around 2017 solutions have been proposed by existing tech companies and by start ups dedicated to loneliness reduction solutions that have become available since 2017 tend to fall under 4 different approaches 1 mindfulness apps that aim to change an individual s attitude towards loneliness emphasising possible benefits and trying to shift towards an experience more similar to voluntary solitude 2 apps that warn users when they re starting to spend too much time online which is based on research findings that moderate use of digital technology can be beneficial but that excessive time online can increase loneliness 3 apps that help people connect with others including to arrange real life meetups 4 ai related technologies that provide digital companionship such companions can be conventionally virtual having existence only when their application is switched on can have an independent digital life their program may run all the time in the cloud allowing them to interact with the user across different platforms like instagram twitter in similar ways to how a real human friend might behave or can have a physical presence like a pepper robot as far back as the 1960s some individuals had stated they prefer communicating with the eliza computer program rather than regular human beings ai driven applications available in the 2020s are considerably more advanced able to remember previous conversations with some ability to sense emotional states and to tailor their interaction accordingly an example of a start up working on such technology is edward saatchis fable studio inspired by the joi character in blade runner 2049 saatchi seeks to create digital friends that can help alleviate loneliness as they ll be in some senses beyond human untainted by negative motivators like greed or envy and with enhanced powers of attention they may be able to help people be kinder and gentler to others and so assist with loneliness relief on a society wide level as well as directly with individuals effectiveness of digital technology interventions a 2021 systematic review and meta analysis on the effectiveness of digital technology interventions dtis in reducing loneliness in older adults found no evidence supporting that dtis reduce loneliness in older adults with an average age from 73 to 78 years sd 6 11 dtis studied included social internet based activities that is social activities via social websites videoconferencing customized computer platforms with simplified touch screen interfaces personal reminder information and social management systems whatsapp groups and video or voice networks religion studies have found an association with religion and the reduction of loneliness especially among the elderly the studies sometimes include caveats such as that religions with strong behavioural prescriptions can have isolating effects in the 21st century numerous religious organisations have begun to undertake efforts explicitly focusing on loneliness reduction religious figures have also played a role in raising awareness of the problem of loneliness for example pope francis said in 2013 that loneliness of the old along with youth unemployment were the most serious evils of the age others nostalgia has also been found to have a restorative effect counteracting loneliness by increasing perceived social support vivek murthy has stated that the most generally available cure for loneliness is human connection murthy argues that regular people have a vital role to play as individuals in reducing loneliness for themselves and others in part by greater emphases on kindness and on nurturing relationships with others effectiveness professor stella mills has suggested that while social loneliness can be relatively easy to address with group activities and other measures that help build connections between people effective intervention against emotional loneliness can be more challenging mills argues that such intervention is more likely to succeed for individuals who are in the early stages of loneliness before the effects caused by chronic loneliness are deeply engrained a 2010 meta study compared the effectiveness of four interventions improving social skills enhancing social support increasing opportunities for social interaction and addressing abnormal social cognition faulty patterns of thoughts such as the hyper vigilance often caused by chronic loneliness the results of the study indicated that all interventions were effective in reducing loneliness possibly with the exception of social skill training results of the meta analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness a 2019 umbrella review of systematic reviews focussing on the effectiveness of loneliness relief efforts aimed just at older people also found that those targeting social cognition were most effective a 2018 overview of systematic reviews concerning the effectiveness of loneliness interventions found that generally there is little solid evidence that intervention are effective though they also found no reason to believe the various types of intervention did any harm except they cautioned against the excessive use of digital technology the authors called for more rigorous best practice compliant research in future studies and with more attention to the cost of interventions history loneliness has been a theme in literature throughout the ages as far back as epic of gilgamesh yet according to fay bound alberti it was only around the year 1800 that the word began to widely denote a negative condition with some exceptions earlier writings and dictionary definitions of loneliness tended to equate it with solitude a state that was often seen as positive unless taken to excess from about 1800 the word loneliness began to acquire its modern definition as a painful subjective condition this may be due to the economic and social changes arising out of the enlightenment such as alienation and increased interpersonal competition along with a reduction in the proportion of people enjoying close and enduring connections with others living in close proximity as may for example have been the case for modernising pastoral villages despite growing awareness of the problem of loneliness widespread social recognition of the problem remained limited and scientific study was sparse until the last quarter of the twentieth century one of the earliest studies of loneliness was published by joseph harold sheldon in 1948 the 1950 book the lonely crowd helped further raise the profile of loneliness among academics for the general public awareness was raised by the 1966 beatles song eleanor rigby according to eugene garfield it was robert s weiss who brought the attention of scientists to the topic of loneliness with his 1973 publication of loneliness the experience of emotional and social isolation before weiss s publication what few studies of loneliness existed were mostly focussed on older adults following weis s work and especially after the 1978 publication of the ucla loneliness scale scientific interest in the topic has broadened and deepened considerably with tens of thousands of academic studies having been carried to investigate loneliness just among students with many more focussed on other subgroups and on whole populations concern among the general public over loneliness increased in the decades since eleanor rigby s release by 2018 government backed anti loneliness campaigns had been launched in countries including the uk denmark and australia see also notes and references further reading rodriguez a 24 december 2023 americans are lonely and it s

such a process encounters mixed fortunes due to its amateur nature although self motivation is a major asset the value of self healing lies in its ability to be tailored to the unique experience and requirements of the individual the process can be helped and accelerated with introspection techniques such as meditation the different meanings of self healing self healing may refer to automatic homeostatic processes of the body that are controlled by physiological mechanisms inherent in the organism disorders of the spirit and the absence of faith can be self healed in a figurative sense self healing properties can be ascribed to systems or processes which by nature or design tend to correct any disturbances brought into them such as the regeneration of the skin after a cut or scrape or of an entire limb the injured party the living body repairs the damaged part by itself beyond the innate restorative capacities of the physical body there are many factors of psychological nature that can influence self healing hippocrates considered by many to be the father of medical treatment observed the physician must be ready not only to do his duty himself but also to secure the co operation of the patient of the attendants and of externals self healing may also be achieved through deliberately applied psychological mechanisms these approaches may improve the psychological and physical conditions of a person research confirms that this can be achieved through numerous mechanisms including relaxation breathing exercises fitness exercises imagery meditation yoga qigong tai chi biofeedback and various forms of psychotherapy among other approaches varieties of mechanisms for self healing have been proposed including decreases in stress hormones that may impair physiological functions when there is chronic stress decreases in muscle tension which can worsen or produce pains in muscles tendons and joints when there is chronic muscle tension due to stress improved sleep that can be achieved through relaxation which improves physiological functions improvements in emotional tensions depression anger and other emotions that can otherwise impair social relationships and functioning in the workplace leading to vicious circles of increased psychological symptoms another phrase that often includes self healing is self help in 2013 kathryn schulz

or regard for one s own happiness or advantage has been conceptualized both as a basic human necessity and as a moral flaw akin to vanity and selfishness synonymous with amour propre conceitedness egotism narcissism et al however throughout the 20th and 21st centuries self love has adopted a more positive connotation through pride parades self respect movement self love protests the hippie era the modern feminist movement 3rd 4th wave as well as the increase in mental health awareness that promotes self love as intrinsic to self help and support groups working to prevent substance abuse and suicide views the hindu arishadvargas major sins are short term self benefiting pursuits that are ultimately damaging these include mada pride jainism believes that the four kashaya passions stop

compassion confucius 551 479 bc and confucianism values society over the self yang zhu 440 360 bc and yangism viewed wei wo or everything for myself as the only virtue necessary for self cultivation all of what is known of yangism comes from its contemporary critics yang s beliefs were hotly contested the thoughts of aristotle 384 322 bc about self love philautia are recorded in the nicomachean ethics and eudemian ethics nicomachean ethics book 9 chapter 8 focuses on it particularly in this passage aristotle argues that people who love themselves to achieve unwarranted personal gain are bad but those who love themselves to achieve virtuous principles are the best sort of good he says the former kind of self love is much more common than the latter cicero 106 43 bc considered those who were sui amantes sine rivali lovers of themselves without rivals were doomed to end in failure jesus c 4 bc 30 ad prioritised the loving of god and commanded his followers to love others selflessly following his example early follower of jesus paul the apostle c 5 64 65 ad wrote that inordinate self love was opposed to love of god in his letter to the phillipian church the author of the new testament letter of james had the same belief christian monk evagrius ponticus 345 399 believed excessive self love hyper\u0113phania pride was one of eight key sins his list of sins was later lightly adapted by pope gregory i as the seven deadly sins this list of sins then became an important part of the doctrine of the western church under this system pride is the original and most deadly of the sins this position was expressed strongly in fiction by dante s the divine comedy augustine 354 430 with his theology of evil as a mere distortion of the good considered that the sin of pride was only a perversion of a normal more modest degree of self love the sikhs believe that the five thieves are the core human weaknesses that steal the innately good common sense from people these selfish desires cause great problems in 1612 francis bacon condemned extreme self lovers who would burn down their own home only to roast themselves an egg in the 1660s baruch spinoza wrote in his book ethics that self preservation was the highest virtue jean jacques rousseau 1712 1778 believed there were two kinds of self love one was amour de soi french for love of self which is the drive for self preservation rousseau considered this drive to be the root of all human drives the other was amour propre often also translated as self love but which also means pride which refers to the self esteem generated from being appreciated by other people the concept of ethical egoism was introduced by the philosopher henry sidgwick in his book the methods of ethics written in 1874 sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of utilitarianism writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure in 1890 psychologist william james examined the concept of self esteem in his influential textbook principles of psychology robert h wozniak later wrote that william james s theory of self love in this book was measured in three different but interrelated aspects of self the material self all those aspects of material existence in which we feel a strong sense of ownership our bodies our families our possessions the social self our felt social relations and the spiritual self our feelings of our own subjectivity in 1956 psychologist and social philosopher erich fromm proposed that loving oneself is different from being arrogant conceited or egocentric meaning that instead caring about oneself and taking responsibility for oneself fromm proposed a re evaluation of self love in more positive sense arguing that in order to be able to truly love another person a person first needs to love oneself in the way of respecting oneself and knowing oneself e g being realistic and honest about one s strengths and weaknesses in the 1960s erik h erikson similarly wrote of a post narcissistic appreciation of the value of the ego while carl rogers saw one result of successful therapy as the regaining of a quiet sense of pleasure in being one s own self self love or self worth was defined in 2003 by aiden gregg and constantine sedikides as referring to a person s subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative mental health lack of self love increases risk of suicide according to the american association of suicidology the association conducted a study in 2008 which researched the impact of low self esteem and lack of self love and its relation to suicidal tendencies and attempts they defined self love as being beliefs about oneself self based self esteem and beliefs about how other people regard oneself other based self esteem it concluded that depression hopelessness and low self esteem are implications of vulnerability factors for suicide ideation and that these findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness low self esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation promotion history self love was first promoted by the beat generation of the 1950s and in the early years of the hippie era of the 1960s after witnessing the devastating consequences of world war ii and having troops still fighting in the vietnam war western especially north american societies began promoting peace and love to help generate positive energy and to promote the preservation of dissipating environmental factors such as the emergence of oil pipelines and the recognition of pollution caused by the greenhouse effect these deteriorating living conditions caused worldwide protests that primarily focused on ending the war but secondarily promoted a positive environment aided by the fundamental concept of crowd psychology this post war community was left very vulnerable to persuasion but began encouraging freedom harmony and the possibility of a brighter non violent future these protests took place on almost all continents and included countries such as the united states primarily new york city and california england and australia their dedication perseverance and empathy towards human life defined this generation as being peace advocates and carefree souls the emergence of the feminist movement began as early as the 19th century but only began having major influence during the second wave movement which included women s rights protests that inevitably led to women gaining the right to vote these protests not only promoted equality but also suggested that women should recognize their self worth through the knowledge and acceptance of self love elizabeth cady stanton used the declaration of independence as a guideline to demonstrate that women have been harshly treated throughout the centuries in her feminist essay titled declaration of sentiments in the essay she claims that all men and women are created equal that among these rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that without these rights the capacity to feel self worth and self love is scarce this historical essay suggests that a lack of self esteem and fear of self love affects modern women due to lingering post industrial gender conditions self love has also been used as a tool in communities of color in the united states in the 1970s black power movement the slogan black is beautiful became a way for african americans to throw off the mantle of predominately white beauty norms the dominant cultural aesthetic pre 1970s was to straighten black hair with a perm or hot comb during the black power movement the afro or fro became the popular hairstyle it involved letting black hair grow naturally without chemical treatment so as to embrace and flaunt the extremely curly hair texture of black people hair was teased out the hair using a pick the goal was to cause the hair to form a halo around the head flaunting the blackness of its wearer this form of self love and empowerment during the 70s was a way for african americans to combat the stigma against their natural hair texture which was and still is largely seen as unprofessional in the modern workplace modern platforms the emergence of social media has created a platform for self love promotion and mental health awareness in order to end the stigma surrounding mental health and to address self love positively rather than negatively a few modern examples of self love promotion platforms include dove campaign for real beauty commercial marketing campaign slutwalk to write love on her arms literary references beck bhar brown ghahramanlou holloway 2008 self esteem and suicide ideation in psychiatric outpatients suicide and life threatening behavior 38 malvolio is described as sick of self love a distempered appetite in twelfth night i v 85 6 lacking self perspective self love or self worth was later defined by a p gregg and c sedikides

emotion regulation is the ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible to permit spontaneous reactions as well as the ability to delay spontaneous reactions as needed it can also be defined as extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring evaluating and modifying emotional reactions the self regulation of emotion belongs to the broader set of emotion regulation processes which includes both the regulation of one s own feelings and the regulation of other people s feelings emotion regulation is a complex process that involves initiating inhibiting or modulating one s state or behavior in a given situation for example the subjective experience feelings cognitive responses thoughts emotion related physiological responses for example heart rate or hormonal activity and emotion related behavior bodily actions or expressions functionally emotion regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one s attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction emotion regulation is a highly significant function in human life every day people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing stimuli inappropriate extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society therefore people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time generally speaking emotion dysregulation has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional arousal on the organization and quality of thoughts actions and interactions individuals who are emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns of responding in which there is a mismatch between their goals responses and or modes of expression and the demands of the social environment for example there is a significant association between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of depression anxiety eating pathology and substance abuse higher levels of emotion regulation are likely to be related to both high levels of social competence and the expression of socially appropriate emotions theory process model the process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion the modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time this sequence occurs as follows situation the sequence begins with a situation real or imagined that is emotionally relevant attention attention is directed towards the emotional situation appraisal the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted response an emotional response is generated giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential behavioral and physiological response systems because an emotional response 4 can cause changes to a situation 1 this model involves a feedback loop from 4 response to 1 situation this feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively is ongoing and dynamic the process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation from this conceptualization the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process they occur in the following order situation selection situation modification attentional deployment cognitive change response modulation the process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories antecedent focused and response focused antecedent focused strategies i e situation selection situation modification attentional deployment and cognitive change occur before an emotional response is fully generated response focused strategies i e response modulation occur after an emotional response is fully generated strategies situation selection situation selection is an emotional regulation strategy that involves choosing to avoid or approach a future emotional situation if a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation they are decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion alternatively if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation they are increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology for example avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder effective situation selection is not always an easy task for instance humans display difficulties predicting their emotional responses to future events therefore they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid situation modification situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact situation modification refers specifically to altering one s external physical environment altering one s internal environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change younger and older adults seem to also regulate their emotions through situation modification in differing ways that reflects what type of material they consume ranging from negative neutral and positive livingstone and isaacowitz conducted research where they observed younger and older adults as they viewed different types of material and had the choice to skip what material they saw and it came out that older adults are better able to regulate the negative material focusing mainly on the positive than the younger adults who still consumed positive material but not as much modification this showing that as we age we gain a better understanding of situation modification and being able to emotionally self regulate examples of situation modification may include injecting humor into a speech to elicit laughter or extending the physical distance between oneself and another person attentional deployment attentional deployment involves directing one s attention towards or away from an emotional situation distraction distraction an example of attentional deployment is an early selection strategy which involves diverting one s attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content distraction has been shown to reduce the intensity of painful and emotional experiences to decrease facial responding and neural activation in the amygdala associated with emotion as well as to alleviate emotional distress as opposed to reappraisal individuals show a relative preference to engage in distraction when facing stimuli of high negative emotional intensity this is because distraction easily filters out high intensity emotional content which would otherwise be relatively difficult to appraise and process rumination rumination an example of attentional deployment is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one s attention on one s symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms rumination is generally considered a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress it has also been implicated in a host of disorders including major depression worry worry an example of attentional deployment involves directing attention to thoughts and images concerned with potentially negative events in the future by focusing on these events worrying serves to aid in the down regulation of intense negative emotion and physiological activity while worry may sometimes involve problem solving incessant worry is generally considered maladaptive being a common feature of anxiety disorders particularly generalized anxiety disorder thought suppression thought suppression an example of attentional deployment involves efforts to redirect one s attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one s emotional state although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts this strategy is generally considered maladaptive being most associated with obsessive compulsive disorder cognitive change cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning reappraisal reappraisal an example of cognitive change is a late selection strategy which involves a change of the meaning of an event that alters its emotional impact it encompasses different substrategies such as positive reappraisal creating and focusing on a positive aspect of the stimulus decentering reinterpreting an event by broadening one s perspective to see the bigger picture or fictional reappraisal adopting or emphasizing the belief that event is not real that it is for instance just a movie or just my imagination reappraisal has been shown to effectively reduce physiological subjective and neural emotional responding as opposed to distraction individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion regulation strategy compared to suppression including both thought suppression and expressive suppression which is positively correlated with many psychological disorders reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes and can be positively related to well being however some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive furthermore some research has shown reappraisal does not influence or affect physiological responses to recurrent stress distancing distancing an example of cognitive change involves taking on an independent third person perspective when evaluating an emotional event distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self reflection facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli and increasing problem solving behavior humour humour an example of cognitive change has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy specifically positive good natured humour has been shown to effectively up regulate positive emotion and down regulate negative emotion on the other hand negative mean spirited humour is less effective in this regard response modulation response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential behavioral and physiological response systems expressive suppression expressive suppression an example of response modulation involves inhibiting emotional expressions it has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity subjective feelings of positive emotion heart rate and sympathetic activation however the research findings are mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for down regulating negative emotion research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy compared to reappraisal it is positively correlated with many psychological disorders associated with worse interpersonal outcomes is negatively related to well being and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources however some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive drug use drug use an example of response modulation can be used to alter emotion associated physiological responses for example alcohol can produce sedative and anxiolytic effects and beta blockers can affect sympathetic activation exercise exercise an example of response modulation can be used to down regulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control exercise has been proven to increase emotional health and regulation through hormonal regulation sleep sleep plays a role in emotion regulation although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep studies have shown that sleep specifically rem sleep down regulates reactivity of the amygdala a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions in response to previous emotional experiences on the flip side sleep deprivation is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli this is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex which regulates the amygdala through inhibition together resulting in an overactive emotional brain due to the subsequent lack of emotional control sleep deprivation may be associated with depression impulsivity and mood swings additionally there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair emotion recognition in others borderline personality disorder bpd in its extreme form problems with response modulation is correlated with borderline personality disorder bpd bpd is characterized by an enduring instability in regulating emotions relationships with others your self image and your behavior this can lead to self sabotage risk taking impulsivity and aggression research has indicated that the heightened emotional response can be due to an exaggerated amygdala response and an impaired anterior cingulate cortex which is responsible for modulating emotions this can lead to an intense emotional response in psychotherapy emotion regulation strategies are taught and emotion regulation problems are treated in a variety of counseling and psychotherapy approaches including cognitive behavioral therapy cbt dialectical behavior therapy dbt emotion focused therapy eft and mindfulness based cognitive therapy mbct for example a relevant mnemonic formulated in dbt is abc please accumulate positive experiences build mastery by being active in activities that make one feel competent and effective to combat helplessness cope ahead preparing an action plan researching and rehearsing with a skilled helper if necessary physical illness treatment and prevention through checkups low vulnerability to diseases managed with health care professionals eating healthy avoiding non prescribed mood altering drugs sleep healthy exercise regularly developmental process infancy intrinsic emotion regulation efforts during infancy are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems these systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli at three months infants can engage in self soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress for instance infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips between three and six months basic motor functioning and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations infants may also engage in self distraction and help seeking behaviors for regulatory purposes at one year infants are able to navigate their surroundings more actively and respond to emotional stimuli with greater flexibility due to improved motor skills they also begin to appreciate their caregivers abilities to provide them regulatory support for instance infants generally have difficulties regulating fear as a result they often find ways to express fear in ways that attract the comfort and attention of caregivers extrinsic emotion regulation efforts by caregivers including situation selection modification and distraction are particularly important for infants the emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to up regulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants emotional and behavioral development teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation the type of attachment style between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants singing play songs can have a visible affect regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress in addition to proven facilitation of social bonding when combined with movement and or rhythmic touch maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the nicu and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties toddler hood by the end of the first year toddlers begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal these strategies can include rocking themselves chewing on objects or moving away from things that upset them at two years toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies they can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states additionally maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors for example caregivers help teach self regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events like a vaccination shot or helping them understand frightening events childhood emotion regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood for example children aged six to ten begin to understand display rules they come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated for example children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift during childhood there is also a trend towards the use of more cognitive emotion regulation strategies taking the place of more basic distraction approach and avoidance tactics regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display and have difficulties regulating high levels of negative emotion adolescence adolescents show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions and emotion regulation decision making becomes more complex depending on multiple factors in particular the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents when regulating their emotions adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context for instance adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers additionally spontaneous use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies increases during adolescence which is evidenced both by self report data and neural markers adulthood social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age as people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase autonomic responsiveness decreases with age and emotion regulation skill tends to increase emotional regulation in adulthood can also be examined in terms of positive and negative affectivity positive and negative affectivity refers to the types of emotions felt by an individual as well as the way those emotions are expressed with adulthood comes an increased ability to maintain both high positive affectivity and low negative affectivity more rapidly than adolescents this response to life s challenges seems to become automatized as people progress throughout adulthood thus as individuals age their capability of self regulating emotions and responding to their emotions in healthy ways improves additionally emotional regulation may vary between young adults and older adults younger adults have been found to be more successful than older adults in practicing cognitive reappraisal to decrease negative internal emotions on the other hand older adults have been found to be more successful in the following emotional regulation areas predicting the level of emotional arousal in possible situations having a higher focus on positive information rather than negative maintaining healthy levels of hedonic well being subjective well being based on increased pleasure and decreased pain overview of perspectives neuropsychological perspective affective as people age their affect the way they react to emotions changes either positively or negatively studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s negative affect on the other hand decreases until the mid 70s studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood particularly affect positive or negative although some studies found that individuals experience less affect as they grow older other studies have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people a reason that older people middle adulthood might have less negative affect is because they have overcome the trials and vicissitudes of youth they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect at least up until their mid 70s positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life the 70s it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same this might be due to failing health reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives in addition to baseline levels of positive and negative affect studies have found individual differences in the time course of emotional responses to stimuli the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation also known as affective chronometry include two key variables in the emotional response process rise time to peak emotional response and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories as previous research has shown despite some correlation the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with anxiety mood and personality disorders but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques including mindfulness training on emotional dysregulation neurological the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level specifically research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation these regions include the orbital prefrontal cortex the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation an implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation sociological people intuitively mimic facial expressions it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning similarities across cultures in regards to nonverbal communication has prompted the debate that it is in fact a universal language it can be argued that emotion regulation plays a key role in the ability to generate the correct responses in social situations humans have control over facial expressions both consciously and unconsciously an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction it is a well documented phenomenon that emotions have an effect on facial expression but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true this notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well emotion regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating organismic needs with environmental demands cole 1994 this skill although apparent throughout all nationalities has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups in experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation these findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions this ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental expressive regulation in solitary conditions in solitary conditions emotion regulation can include a minimization miniaturization effect in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression unlike other situations in which physical expression and its regulation serve a social purpose i e conforming to display rules or revealing emotion to outsiders solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway the idea behind this is that as people get older they learn that the purpose of outward expression to appeal to other people is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to as a result the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations stress the way an individual reacts to stress can directly overlap with their ability to regulate emotion although the two concepts differ in a multitude of ways both coping with stress and emotion regulation involve affect modulation and appraisal processes that are necessary for healthy relationships and self identity according to yu v shcherbatykh emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self regulating activities prior to the task being performed to study the influence of self regulation on mental and physiological processes under exam stress shcherbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students of both sexes and a control group of 102 students also of both sexes in the moments before the examination situational stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states in the experimental group participants engaged in three self regulating techniques concentration on respiration general body relaxation and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination during the examination the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group also the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1 7 times less than in the control group from this data shcherbatykh concluded that the application of self regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain which can help lead to better performance results emotion regulation has also been associated with physiological responses to stress during laboratory stress paradigms decision making identification of our emotional self regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences there is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotion regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications digital emotion regulation following widespread adoption in the 21st century of digital devices and services for use in everyday life evidence is mounting that people are increasingly using these tools to manage and regulate moods and emotions a wide range of digital resources are used for emotion regulation including smartphones social media streaming services online shopping and videogames such spontaneous forms of digital emotion regulation can be distinguished from the use of digital interventions such as smartphone apps that have been explicitly designed to support emotional regulation or teach emotion regulation skills in clinical and non clinical populations digital implementation of emotion regulation strategies can occur at all stages of the process model and in all strategy families including interpersonal emotion regulation effects of low self regulation with a failure in emotion regulation there is a rise in psychosocial and emotional dysfunctions caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions these traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with bullying children who can t properly self regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways including screaming if they don t have their way lashing out with their fists throwing objects such as chairs or bullying other children such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment which in turn can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time a process termed cumulative continuity these children are more likely to have conflict based relationships with their teachers and other children this can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later children who fail to properly self regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems their peers begin to notice this immaturity and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers this immaturity certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways being teased or being an outcast in childhood is especially damaging because it could lead to psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety in which dysregulated emotions play a central role which in turn could lead to more peer victimization this is why it is recommended to foster emotional self regulation in children as early as possible occupational therapy in schools occupational therapists ots are integrated educators in most public and private schools across the united states they are trained in mental health and activity analysis to assess the needs of their clients ots and students work together to create meaningful and healthy habits for stress management social skills emotional labeling coping strategies awareness problem solving self monitoring judgment emotional control and others in the school and home environment ots can complete formal assessments for emotional regulation and treat in a client centered manner for each student in addition they can create individualized home programs for carryover with their families for example ots can work with students to engage in the occupational therapist developed curriculum the zones of regulation which utilizes evidence based knowledge formal assessment and in classroom treatment to improve self regulation of emotional behaviors and create long lasting changes in habits early childhood access to education on emotional regulation mitigates risk factors for increased anxiety depression and negative behaviors it allows the student to create healthy habits for school and home environments children should be able to learn to regulate their feelings for full participation in activities including social skills play sports and school see also

compassion overview a resilient person uses mental processes and behaviors in promoting personal assets and protecting self from the potential negative effects of stressors psychological resilience is an adaptation in a person s psychological traits and experiences that allows them to regain or remain in a healthy mental state during crises chaos without long term negative consequences it is difficult to measure and test this psychological construct because resilience can be interpreted in a variety of ways most psychological paradigms biomedical cognitive behavioral sociocultural etc have their own perspective of what resilience looks like where it comes from and how it can be developed there are numerous definitions of psychological resilience most of which center around two concepts adversity and positive adaptation positive emotions social support and hardiness can influence a person to become more resilient a psychologically resilient person can resist adverse mental conditions that are often associated with unfavorable life circumstances this differs from psychological recovery which is associated with returning to those mental conditions that preceded a traumatic experience or personal loss research on psychological resilience has shown that it plays a crucial role in promoting mental health and well being resilient people are better equipped to navigate life s challenges maintain positive emotions and recover from setbacks they demonstrate higher levels of self efficacy optimism and problem solving skills which contribute to their ability to adapt and thrive in adverse situations resilience is a positive adaptation after a stressful or adverse situation when a person is bombarded by daily stress it disrupts their internal and external sense of balance presenting challenges as well as opportunities the routine stressors of daily life can have positive impacts which promote resilience some psychologists believe that it is not stress itself that promotes resilience but rather the person s perception of their stress and of their level of control stress allows people to practice resilience over time different levels of stress vary among different individuals and the reason for that being is unknown however it is known that some people can handle stress better than others stress can be experienced in a person s life course at times of difficult life transitions involving developmental and social change traumatic life events including grief and loss and environmental pressures encompassing poverty and community violence resilience is the integrated adaptation of physical mental and spiritual aspects to circumstances and a coherent sense of self that is able to maintain normative developmental tasks that occur at various stages of life the children s institute of the university of rochester explains that resilience research is focused on studying those who engage in life with hope and humor despite devastating losses resilience is not only about overcoming a deeply stressful situation but also coming out of such a situation with competent functioning resiliency allows a person to rebound from adversity as a strengthened and more resourceful person some characteristics associated with psychological resilience include an easy temperament good self esteem planning skills and a supportive environment inside and outside of the family when an event is appraised as comprehensible predictable manageable controllable and somehow meaningful explainable a resilient response is more likely process psychological resilience is commonly understood as a process it can also be characterized as a tool a person develops over time or as a personal trait of the person resiliency most research shows resilience as the result of people being able to interact with their environments and participate in processes that either promote well being or protect them against the overwhelming influence of relative risk this research supports the model in which psychological resilience is seen as a process rather than a trait something to develop or pursue rather than a static endowment or endpoint when people are faced with an adverse condition there are three ways in which they may approach the situation respond with anger or aggression become overwhelmed and shut down feel the emotion about the situation and appropriately handle the emotion resilience is promoted through the third approach which is employed by individuals who adapt and change their current patterns to cope with disruptive states thereby enhancing their well being in contrast the first and second approaches lead individuals to adopt a victim mentality blaming others and rejecting coping methods even after a crisis has passed these individuals tend to react instinctively rather than respond thoughtfully clinging to negative emotions such as fear anger anxiety distress helplessness and hopelessness such emotions decrease problem solving abilities and weaken resilience making it harder to recover resilient people on the other hand actively cope bounce back and find solutions their resilience is further supported by protective environments including good families schools communities and social policies which provide cumulative protective factors that bolster their ability to withstand and recover from exposure to risk factors resilience can be viewed as a developmental process the process of developing resilience or as indicated by a response process in the latter approach the effects of an event or stressor on a situationally relevant indicator variable are studied distinguishing immediate responses dynamic responses and recovery patterns in response to a stressor more resilient people show some but less than less resilient people increase in stress the speed with which this stress response returns to pre stressor levels is also indicative of a person s resilience biological models from a scientific standpoint resilience s contested definition is multifaceted in relation to genetics revealing a complex link between biological mechanisms and resilience resilience conceptualized as a positive bio psychological adaptation has proven to be a useful theoretical context for understanding variables for predicting long term health and well being three notable bases for resilience self confidence self esteem and self concept each have roots in a different nervous system respectively the somatic nervous system the autonomic nervous system and the central nervous system research indicates that like trauma resilience is influenced by epigenetic modifications increased dna methylation of the growth factor gdnf in certain brain regions promotes stress resilience as do molecular adaptations of the blood brain barrier the two neurotransmitters primarily responsible for stress buffering within the brain are dopamine and endogenous opioids as evidenced by research showing that dopamine and opioid antagonists increased stress response in both humans and animals primary and secondary rewards reduce negative reactivity primary rewards are stimuli that are attributed to basic needs such as water food and physical well being on the other hand secondary rewards are accomplished by experiences or social interactions of stress in the brain in both humans and animals the relationship between social support and stress resilience is thought to be mediated by the oxytocin system s impact on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis alongside such neurotransmitters stress induced alterations in brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex pfc and hippocampus have been linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety the increased activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and glutamatergic circuits has emerged as a potential factor in enhancing resilience as environmental enrichment increases the complexity of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus and pfc suggesting a shared feature of resilience under these two distinct condition s history the first research on resilience was published in 1973 the study used epidemiology the study of disease prevalence to uncover the risks and the protective factors that now help define resilience a year later the same group of researchers created tools to look at systems that support development of resilience emmy werner was one of the early scientists to use the term resilience she studied a cohort of children from kauai hawaii kauai was quite poor and many of the children in the study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents many of the parents were also out of work werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations two thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years such as chronic unemployment substance abuse and out of wedlock births in girls however one third of these youths did not exhibit destructive behaviors werner called the latter group resilient thus resilient children and their families were those who by definition demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non resilient children and families resilience also emerged as a major theoretical and research topic in the 1980s in studies of children with mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia a 1989 study showed that children with a schizophrenic parent may not obtain an appropriate level of comforting caregiving compared to children with healthy parents and that such situations often had a detrimental impact on children s development on the other hand some children of ill parents thrived and were competent in academic achievement which led researchers to make efforts to understand such responses to adversity since the onset of the research on resilience researchers have been devoted to discovering protective factors that explain people s adaptation to adverse conditions such as maltreatment catastrophic life events or urban poverty researchers endeavor to uncover how some factors e g connection to family may contribute to positive outcomes trait resilience temperamental and constitutional disposition is a major factor in resilience it is one of the necessary precursors of resilience along with warmth in family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems there are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in resilience the appetitive system defensive system and attentional system trait resilience is negatively correlated with the personality traits of neuroticism and negative emotionality which represent tendencies to see and react to the world as threatening problematic and distressing and to view oneself as vulnerable trait resilience is positively correlated with personality traits of openness and positive emotionality which are associated with tendencies to approach and confront problems with confidence while also maintaining autonomy and fostering adaptability to those life changes resilience traits are personal characteristics that express how people approach and react to events that they experience as negative trait resilience is generally considered via two methods direct assessment of traits through resilience measures and proxy assessments of resilience in which existing cognate psychological constructs are used to explain resilient outcomes typically trait resilience measures explore how individuals tend to react to and cope with adverse events proxy assessments of resilience sometimes referred to as the buffering approach view resilience as the antithesis of risk focusing on how psychological processes interrelate with negative events to mitigate their effects possibly an individual perseverance trait conceptually related to persistence and resilience could also be measured behaviorally by means of arduous difficult or otherwise unpleasant tasks developing and sustaining resilience there are several theories or models that attempt to describe subcomponents prerequisites predictors or correlates of resilience fletcher and sarkar found five factors that develop and sustain a person s resilience the ability to make realistic plans and being capable of taking the steps necessary to follow through with them confidence in one s strengths and abilities communication and problem solving skills the ability to manage strong impulses and feelings having good self esteem among older adults kamalpour et al found that the important factors are external connections grit independence self care self acceptance altruism hardship experience health status and positive perspective on life another study examined thirteen high achieving professionals who seek challenging situations that require resilience all of whom had experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving the study found six main predictors of resilience positive and proactive personality experience and learning sense of control flexibility and adaptability balance and perspective and perceived social support high achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies exercising and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones the american psychological association in its popular psychology oriented psychology topics publication suggests the following tactics people can use to build resilience prioritize relationships join a social group take care of your body practice mindfulness avoid negative coping outlets like alcohol use help others be proactive search for solutions make progress toward your goals look for opportunities for self discovery keep things in perspective accept change maintain a hopeful outlook learn from your past the idea that one can build one s resilience implies that resilience is a developable characteristic and so is perhaps at odds with the theory that resilience is a process positive emotions the relationship between positive emotions and resilience has been extensively studied people who maintain positive emotions while they face adversity are more flexibile in their thinking and problem solving positive emotions also help people recover from stressful experiences people who maintain positive emotions are better defended from the physiological effects of negative emotions and are better equipped to cope adaptively to build enduring social resources and to enhance their well being the ability to consciously monitor the factors that influence one s mood is correlated with a positive emotional state this is not to say that positive emotions are merely a by product of resilience but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process resilient people who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions such as benefit finding and cognitive reappraisal humor optimism and goal directed problem focused coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities positive emotions have physiological consequences for example humor leads to improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary immunoglobulin a a vital system antibody which serves as the body s first line of defense in respiratory illnesses other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly and reductions in the length of hospital stay one study has found early indications that older adults who have increased levels of psychological resilience have decreased odds of death or inability to walk after recovering from hip fracture surgery in another study trait resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions more quickly rebounded from cardiovascular activation that was initially generated by negative emotional arousal social support social support is an important factor in the development of resilience while many competing definitions of social support exist they tend to concern one s degree of access to and use of strong ties to other people who are similar to oneself social support requires solidarity and trust intimate communication and mutual obligation both within and outside the family military studies have found that resilience is also dependent on group support unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization resilience is highly correlated with peer support and group cohesion units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale high cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions war veterans who had more social support were less likely to develop post traumatic stress disorder cognitive behavioral therapy a number of self help approaches to resilience building have been developed drawing mainly on cognitive behavioral therapy cbt and rational emotive behavior therapy rebt for example a group cognitive behavioral intervention called the penn resiliency program prp fosters aspects of resilience a meta analysis of 17 prp studies showed that the intervention significantly reduces depressive symptoms over time in cbt building resilience is a matter of mindfully changing behaviors and thought patterns the first step is to change the nature of self talk the internal monologue people have that reinforces beliefs about their self efficacy and self value to build resilience a person needs to replace negative self talk such as i can t do this and i can t handle this with positive self talk this helps to reduce psychological stress when a person faces a difficult challenge the second step is to prepare for challenges crises and emergencies businesses prepare by creating emergency response plans business continuity plans and contingency plans similarly an individual can create a financial cushion to help with economic stressors maintain supportive social networks and develop emergency response plans language learning and communication language learning and communication help develop resilience in people who travel study abroad work internationally or in those who find themselves as refugees in countries where their home language is not spoken research conducted by the british council found a strong relationship between language and resilience in refugees providing adequate english learning programs and support for syrian refugees builds resilience not only in the individual but also in the host community language builds resilience in five ways home language and literacy development development of home language and literacy helps create the foundation for a shared identity by maintaining the home language even when displaced a person not only learns better in school but enhances their ability to learn other languages this improves resilience by providing a shared culture and sense of identity that allows refugees to maintain close relationships to others who share their identity and sets them up to possibly return one day access to education training and employment this allows refugees to establish themselves in their host country and provides more ease when attempting to access information apply to work or school or obtain professional documentation securing access to education or employment is largely dependent on language competency and both education and employment provide security and success that enhance resilience and confidence learning together and social cohesion learning together encourages resilience through social cohesion and networks when refugees engage in language learning activities with host communities engagement and communication increases both refugee and host community are more likely to celebrate diversity share their stories build relationships engage in the community and provide each other with support this creates a sense of belonging with the host communities alongside the sense of belonging established with other members of the refugee community through home language addressing the effects of trauma on learning additionally language programs and language learning can help address the effects of trauma by providing a means to discuss and understand refugees are more capable of expressing their trauma including the effects of loss when they can effectively communicate with their host community especially in schools language learning establishes safe spaces through storytelling which further reinforces comfort with a new language and can in turn lead to increased resilience building inclusivity this is more focused on providing resources by providing institutions or schools with more language based learning and cultural material the host community can learn how to better address the needs of the refugee community this feeds back into the increased resilience of refugees by creating a sense of belonging and community another study shows the impacts of storytelling in building resilience it aligns with many of the five factors identified by the study completed by the british council as it emphasizes the importance of sharing traumatic experiences through language it showed that those who were exposed to more stories from family or friends had a more holistic view of life s struggles and were thus more resilient especially when surrounded by foreign languages or attempting to learn a new language development programs the head start program promotes resilience as does the big brothers big sisters programme centered coaching consulting the abecedarian early intervention project and social programs for youth with emotional or behavioral difficulties the positive behavior supports and intervention program is a trauma informed resilience based program for elementary age students it has four components positive reinforcements such as encouraging feedback understanding that behavior is a response to unmet needs or a survival response promoting belonging mastery and independence and creating an environment to support the student through sensory tools mental health breaks and play tuesday s children a family service organization works to build psychological resilience through programs such as mentoring and project common bond an eight day peace building and leadership initiative for people aged 15 20 from around the world who have been directly impacted by terrorism military organizations test personnel for the ability to function under stressful circumstances by deliberately subjecting them to stress during training those students who do not exhibit the necessary resilience can be screened out of the training those who remain can be given stress inoculation training the process is repeated as personnel apply for increasingly demanding positions such as special forces an example of psychological resilience can be seen in survivors of natural disasters who manage to rebuild their lives despite profound personal loss such individuals often demonstrate adaptability emotional strength and a capacity to regain stability after trauma other factors another protective factor involves external social support which helps moderate the negative effects of environmental hazards or stressful situations and guides vulnerable individuals toward optimistic paths one study distinguished three contexts for protective factors personal attributes traits such as an outgoing personality perceptiveness and a positive self concept family environment close and supportive relationships with at least one family member or an emotionally stable parent community support support and guidance from peers and community members a study of the elderly in zurich switzerland illuminated the role humor plays to help people remain happy in the face of age related adversity research has also been conducted into individual differences in resilience self esteem ego control and ego resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation maltreated children who feel good about themselves may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and thereby avoiding negative internalized self perceptions ego control is the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual with regard to the expression or containment 43 of their impulses feelings and desires ego resilience refers to the dynamic capacity to modify his or her model level of ego control in either direction as a function of the demand characteristics of the environmental context 43 demographic information e g gender and resources e g social support also predict resilience after disaster women tend to show less resilience than men and people who were less involved in affinity groups and organisations also showed less resilience certain aspects of religions spirituality or mindfulness could promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience however as of 2009 the there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues in a review of the literature on the relationship between religiosity spirituality and ptsd about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity spirituality and resilience the united states army was criticized for promoting spirituality in its comprehensive soldier fitness program as a way to prevent ptsd due to the lack of conclusive supporting data forgiveness plays a role in resilience among patients with chronic pain but not in the severity of the pain resilience is also enhanced in people who develop effective coping skills for stress coping skills help people reduce stress levels so they remain functional coping skills include using meditation exercise socialization and self care practices to maintain a healthy level of stress bibliotherapy positive tracking of events and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building increasing a person s arsenal of coping skills builds resilience a study of 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety showed that emotional regulation contributed to resilience in patients the emotional regulation strategies focused on planning positively reappraising events and reducing rumination patients with improved resilience experienced better treatment outcomes than patients with non resilience focused treatment plans this suggests psychotherapeutic interventions may better handle mental disorders by focusing on psychological resilience other factors associated with resilience include the capacity to make realistic plans self confidence and a positive self image communications skills and the capacity to manage strong feelings and impulses children adverse childhood experiences aces are events that occur in a child s life that could lead to maladaptive symptoms such as tension low mood repetitive and recurring thoughts and avoidance of things associated with the adverse event maltreated children who experience some risk factors e g single parenting limited maternal education or family unemployment show lower ego resilience and intelligence than children who were not maltreated maltreated children are also more likely to withdraw and demonstrate disruptive aggressive and internalized behavior problems ego resiliency and positive self esteem predict competent adaptation in maltreated children psychological resilience which helps overcome adverse events does not solely explain why some children experience post traumatic growth and some do not resilience is the product of a number of developmental processes over time that allow children to experience small exposures to adversity or age appropriate challenges and develop skills to handle those challenges this gives children a sense of pride and self worth two protective factors characteristics of children or situations that help children in the context of risk are good cognitive functioning like cognitive self regulation and iq and positive relationships especially with competent adults like parents children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts however children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity there are a few protective factors of young children that are consistent over differences in culture and stressors poverty war divorce of parents natural disasters etc capable parenting other close relationships intelligence self control motivation to succeed self confidence and self efficacy faith hope belief life has meaning effective schools effective communities effective cultural practices ann masten calls these protective factors ordinary magic the ordinary human adaptive systems that are shaped by biological and cultural evolution in her book ordinary magic resilience in development she discusses the immigrant paradox the phenomenon that first generation immigrant youth are more resilient than their children researchers hypothesize that there may be culturally based resiliency that is lost with succeeding generations as they become distanced from their culture of origin another hypothesis is that those who choose to immigrate are more likely to be more resilient neurocognitive resilience trauma is defined as an emotional response to distressing event and ptsd is a mental disorder the develops after a person has experienced a dangerous event for instance car accident or environmental disaster the findings of a study conducted on a sample of 226 individuals who had experienced trauma indicate a positive association between resilience and enhanced nonverbal memory as well as a measure of emotional learning the findings of the study indicate that individuals who exhibited resilience demonstrated a lower incidence of depressed and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd symptoms conversely those who lacked resilience exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing unemployment and having a history of suicide attempts the research additionally revealed that the experience of severe childhood abuse or exposure to trauma was correlated with a lack of resilience the results indicate that resilience could potentially serve as a substitute measure for emotional learning a process that is frequently impaired in stress related mental disorders this finding has the potential to enhance our comprehension of resilience young adults sports provide benefits such as social support or a boost in self confidence the findings of a study investigating the correlation between resilience and symptom resolution in adolescents and young adults who have experienced sport related concussions src indicate that individuals with lower initial resilience ratings tend to exhibit a higher number and severity of post concussion symptoms pcss elevated levels of anxiety and depression and a delayed recovery process from src additionally the research revealed that those who initially scored lower on resilience assessments were less inclined to describe a sense of returning to their pre injury state and experienced more pronounced exacerbation of symptoms resulting from both physical and cognitive exertion even after resuming sports or physical activity this finding illustrates the significant impact that resilience can have on the process of physical and mental recovery role of the family family environments that are caring and stable hold high expectations for children s behavior and encourage participation by children in the life of the family are environments that more successfully foster resilience in children most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult not always a parent and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord parental resilience the ability of parents to deliver competent high quality parenting despite the presence of risk factors plays an important role in children s resilience understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience however resilience research has focused on the well being of children with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents even if divorce produces stress the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes a family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores caring for brothers or sisters and the contribution of part time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience some practices that poor parents utilize help to promote resilience in families these include frequent displays of warmth affection and emotional support reasonable expectations for children combined with straightforward not overly harsh discipline family routines and celebrations and the maintenance of common values regarding money and leisure according to sociologist christopher b doob poor children growing up in resilient families have received significant support for doing well as they enter the social world starting in daycare programs and then in schooling the besht model of natural resilience building through parenting in an ideal family with positive access and support from family and friends has four key markers realistic upbringing effective risk communications positivity and restructuring of demanding situations building self efficacy and hardiness in this model self efficacy is the belief in one s ability to organize and execute the courses of action required to achieve goals and hardiness is a composite of interrelated attitudes of commitment control and challenge role of school resilient children in classroom environments work and play well hold high expectations and demonstrate locus of control self esteem self efficacy and autonomy these things work together to prevent the debilitating behaviors that are associated with learned helplessness research on mexican american high school students found that a sense of belonging to school was the only significant predictor of academic resilience though a sense of belonging to family a peer group and a culture can also indicate higher academic resilience although cultural loyalty overall was not a significant predictor of resilience certain cultural influences nonetheless contribute to resilient outcomes like familism and cultural pride and awareness the results indicate a negative relationship between cultural pride and the ethnic homogeneity of a school the researchers hypothesize that ethnicity becomes a salient and important characteristic in more ethnically diverse settings a strong connection with one s cultural identity is an important protective factor against stress and is indicative of increased resilience while classroom resources have been created to promote resilience in students the most effective ways to ensure resilience in children is by protecting their natural adaptive systems from breaking down or being hijacked at home resilience can be promoted through a positive home environment and emphasizing cultural practices and values in school this can be done by ensuring that each student develops and maintains a sense of belonging to the school through positive relationships with classroom peers and a caring teacher a sense of belonging whether it be in a culture family or another group predicts resiliency against any given stressor role of the community communities play a role in fostering resilience the clearest sign of a cohesive and supportive community is the presence of social organizations that provide healthy human development services are unlikely to be used unless there is good communication about them children who are repeatedly relocated do not benefit from these resources as their opportunities for resilience building community participation are disrupted with every relocation outcomes in adulthood patients who show resilience to adverse events in childhood may have worse outcomes later in life a study in the american journal of psychiatry interviewed 1420 participants with a child and adolescent psychiatric assessment up to 8 times as children of those 1 266 were interviewed as adults and this group had higher risks for anxiety depression and problems with work or education this was accompanied by worse physical health outcomes the study authors posit that the goal of public health should be to reduce childhood trauma and not promote resilience specific situations divorce cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved in divorce the level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and external variables some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools friends and family friends children differ by age gender and temperament in their capacity to cope with divorce about 20 25 of children demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems when going through a divorce compared to 10 of children exhibiting similar problems in married families despite this approximately 75 80 of these children will develop into well adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems this goes to show that most children have the resilience needed to endure their parents divorce the effects of the divorce extend past the separation of the parents residual conflict between parents financial problems and the re partnering or remarriage of parents can cause stress studies have shown conflicting results about the effect of post divorce conflict on a child s healthy adjustment divorce may reduce children s financial means and associated lifestyle for example economizing may mean a child cannot continue to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons which can be detrimental to their social lives a parent s repartnering or remarrying can add conflict and anger to a child s home environment one reason re partnering causes additional stress is because of the lack of clarity in roles and relationships the child may not know how to react and behave with this new quasi parent figure in their life bringing in a new partner spouse may be most stressful when done shortly after the divorce divorce is not a single event but encompasses multiple changes and challenges internal factors promote resiliency in the child as do external factors in the environment certain programs such as the 14 week children s support group and the children of divorce intervention program may help a child cope with the changes that occur from a divorce bullying beyond preventing bullying it is also important to consider interventions based on emotional intelligence when bullying occurs emotional intelligence may foster resilience in victims when a person faces stress and adversity especially of a repetitive nature their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome one study examining adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying found higher behavioral resilience in girls and higher emotional resilience in boys the study s authors suggested the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention emotional intelligence promotes resilience to stress and the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can restrain a victim from going on to perpetuate aggression emotion regulation is an important factor in resilience emotional perception significantly facilitates lower negative emotionality during stress while emotional understanding facilitates resilience and correlates with positive affect natural disasters resilience after a natural disaster can be gauged on an individual level each person in the community a community level everyone collectively in the affected locality and on a physical level the locality s environment and infrastructure unescap funded research on how communities show resiliency in the wake of natural disasters found that communities were more physically resilient if community members banded together and made resiliency a collective effort social support especially the ability to pool resources is key to resilience communities that pooled social natural and economic resources were more resilient and could overcome disasters more quickly than communities that took a more individualistic approach the world economic forum met in 2014 to discuss resiliency after natural disasters they concluded that countries that are more economically sound and whose members can diversify their livelihoods show higher levels of resiliency as of 2014 this had not been studied in depth but the ideas discussed in this forum appeared fairly consistent with existing research individual resilience in the wake of natural disasters can be predicted by the level of emotion the person experienced and was able to process during and following the disaster those who employ emotional styles of coping were able to grow from their experiences and to help others in these instances experiencing emotions was adaptive those who did not engage with their emotions and who employed avoidant and suppressive coping styles had poorer mental health outcomes following disaster death of a family member as of 2006 little research had been done on the topic of family resilience in the wake of the death of a family member clinical attention to bereavement has focused on the individual mourning process rather than on the family unit as a whole resiliency in this context is the ability to maintain a stable equilibrium that is conducive to balance harmony and recovery families manage familial distortions caused by the death of the family member by reorganizing relationships and changing patterns of functioning to adapt to their new situation people who exhibiting resilience in the wake of trauma can successfully traverse the bereavement process without long term negative consequences one of the healthiest behaviors displayed by resilient families in the wake of a death is honest and open communication this facilitates an understanding of the crisis sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long term adaptation empathy is a crucial component in familial resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions tolerate conflict and grapple with differences that may arise another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that binds the family together through regular contact and order the continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member professional settings resilience has been examined in the context of failure and setbacks in workplace settings psychological resilience is one of the core constructs of positive organizational behavior and has captured scholars and practitioners attention research has highlighted certain personality traits personal resources e g self efficacy work life balance social competencies personal attitudes e g sense of purpose job commitment positive emotions and work resources e g social support positive organizational context as potential facilitators of workplace resilience attention has also been directed to the role of resilience in innovative contexts due to high degrees of uncertainty and complexity in the innovation process failure and setbacks happen frequently in this context these can harm affected individuals motivation and willingness to take risks so their resilience is essential for them to productively engage in future innovative activities a resilience construct specifically aligned to the peculiarities of the innovation context was needed to diagnose and develop innovators resilience innovator resilience potential irp based on bandura s social cognitive theory irp has six components self efficacy outcome expectancy optimism hope self esteem and risk propensity it reflects a process perspective on resilience irp can be interpreted either as an antecedent of how a setback affects an innovator or as an outcome of the process that is influenced by the setback situation a measurement scale of irp was developed and validated in 2018 cultural differences there is controversy about the indicators of good psychological and social development when resilience is studied across different cultures and contexts the american psychological association s task force on resilience and strength in black children and adolescents for example notes that there may be special skills that these young people and families have that help them cope including the ability to resist racial prejudice researchers of indigenous health have shown the impact of culture history community values and geographical settings on resilience in indigenous communities people who cope may also show hidden resilience when they do not conform with society s expectations for how someone is supposed to behave for example in some contexts aggression may aid resilience or less emotional engagement may be protective in situations of abuse resilience in individualist and collectivist communities individualist cultures such as those of the u s austria spain and canada emphasize personal goals initiatives and achievements independence self reliance and individual rights are highly valued by members of individualistic cultures the ideal person in individualist societies is assertive strong and innovative people in this culture tend to describe themselves in terms of their unique traits i am analytical and curious economic political and social policies reflect the culture s interest in individualism collectivist cultures such as those of japan sweden turkey and guatemala emphasize family and group work goals the rules of these societies promote unity brotherhood and selflessness families and communities practice cohesion and cooperation the ideal person in collectivist societies is trustworthy honest sensitive and generous emphasizing intrapersonal skills collectivists tend to describe themselves in terms of their roles i am a good husband and a loyal friend in a study on the consequences of disaster on a culture s individualism researchers operationalized these cultures by identifying indicative phrases in a society s literature words that showed the theme of individualism include able achieve differ own personal prefer and special words that indicated collectivism include belong duty give harmony obey share together differences in response to natural disasters natural disasters threaten to destroy communities displace families degrade cultural integrity and diminish an individual s level of functioning comparing individualist community reactions to collectivist community responses after natural disasters illustrates their differences and respective strengths as tools of resilience some suggest that because disasters strengthen the need to rely on other people and social structures they reduce individual agency and the sense of autonomy and so regions with heightened exposure to disaster should cultivate collectivism however interviews with and experiments on disaster survivors indicate that disaster induced anxiety and stress decrease one s focus on social contextual information a key component of collectivism so disasters may increase individualism in a study into the association between socio ecological indicators and cultural level change in individualism for each socio ecological indicator frequency of disasters was associated with greater rather than less individualism supplementary analyses indicated that the frequency of disasters was more strongly correlated with individualism related shifts than was the magnitude of disasters or the frequency of disasters qualified by the number of deaths baby naming is one indicator of change urbanization was linked to preference for uniqueness in baby naming practices at a one year lag secularism was linked to individualist shifts in interpersonal structure at both lags and disaster prevalence was linked to more unique naming practices at both lags secularism and disaster prevalence contributed mainly to shifts in naming practices disaster recovery research focuses on psychology and social systems but does not adequately address interpersonal networking or relationship formation and maintenance one disaster response theory holds that people who use existing communication networks fare better during and after disasters moreover they can play important roles in disaster recovery by organizing and helping others use communication networks and by coordinating with institutions building strong self reliant communities whose members know each other know each other s needs and are aware of existing communication networks is a possible source of resilience in disasters individualist societies promote individual responsibility for self sufficiency collectivist culture defines self sufficiency within an interdependent communal context even where individualism is salient a group thrives when its members choose social over personal goals and seek to maintain harmony and where they value collectivist over individualist behavior the concept of resilience in language while not all languages have a direct translation for the english word resilience nearly every culture has a word that relates to a similar concept suggesting a common understanding of what resilience is even if a word does not directly translate to resilience in english it relays a meaning similar enough to the concept and is used as such within the language if a specific word for resilience does not exist in a language speakers of that language typically assign a similar word that insinuates resilience based on context many languages use words that translate to elasticity or bounce which are used in context to capture the meaning of resilience for example one of the main words for resilience in chinese literally translates to rebound one of the main words for resilience in greek translates to bounce another translates to cheerfulness and one of the main words for resilience in russian translates to elasticity just as it does in german however this is not the case for all languages for example if a spanish speaker wanted to say resilience their main two options translate to resistance and defense against adversity many languages have words that translate better to tenacity or grit better than they do to resilience while these languages may not have a word that exactly translates to resilience english speakers often use the words tenacity or grit when referring to resilience arabic has a word solely for resilience but also two other common expressions to relay the concept which directly translate to capacity on deflation or reactivity of the body but are better translated as impact strength and resilience of the body respectively a few languages such as finnish have words that express resilience in a way that cannot be translated back to english in finnish the word and concept sisu has been recently studied by a designated sisu scale which is composed of both beneficial and harmful sides of sisu sisu measured by the sisu scale has correlations with english langugage equivalents but the harmful side of sisu does not seem to have any corresponding concept in english language based scales sometimes sisu has been translated to grit in english sisu blends the concepts of resilience tenacity determination perseverance and courage into one word that has become a facet of finnish culture measurement direct measurement resilience is measured by evaluating personal qualities that reflect people s approach and response to negative experiences trait resilience is typically assessed using two methods direct evaluation of traits through resilience measures and proxy assessment of resilience in which related psychological constructs are used to explain resilient outcomes there are more than 30 resilience measures that assess over 50 different variables related to resilience but there is no universally accepted gold standard for measuring resilience five of the established self report measures of psychological resilience are ego resiliency scale measures a person s ability to exercise control over their impulses or inhibition in response to environmental demands with the aim of maintaining or enhancing their ego equilibrium hardiness scale encompasses three main dimensions 1 commitment a conviction that life has purpose 2 control confidence in one s ability to navigate life and 3 challenge aptitude for and pleasure in adapting to change psychological resilience scale assesses a resilience core characterized by five traits purposeful life perseverance self reliance equanimity and existential aloneness that reflect an individual s physical and mental resilience throughout their lifespan connor davidson resilience scale developed in a clinical treatment setting that conceptualized resilience as arising from four factors 1 control commitment and change hardiness constructs brief resilience scale assesses resilience as the capacity to bounce back from unfavorable circumstances the resilience systems scales was produced to investigate and measure the underlying structure of the 115 items from these five most commonly cited trait resilience scales in the literature three strong latent factors account for most of the variance accounted for by the five most popular resilience scales and replicated ecological systems theory engineering resilience the capability of a system to quickly and effortlessly restore itself to a stable equilibrium state after a disruption as measured by its speed and ease of recovery ecological resilience the capacity of a system to endure or resist disruptions while preserving a steady state and adapting to necessary changes in its functioning adaptive capacity the ability to continuously adjust functions and processes in order to be ready to adapt to any disruption proxy measurement resilience literature identifies five main trait domains that serve as stress buffers and can be used as proxies to describe resilience outcomes personality a resilient personality includes positive expressions of the five factor personality traits such as high emotional stability extraversion conscientiousness openness and agreeableness cognitive abilities and executive functions resilience is identified through effective use of executive functions and processing of experiential demands or through an overarching cognitive mapping system that integrates information from current situations prior experience and goal driven processes affective systems which include emotional regulation systems emotion regulation systems are based on the broaden and build theory in which there is a reciprocal relationship between trait resilience and positive emotional functioning through emotional management coping and regulation achieved by means of attention control cognitive reappraisal and coping strategies eudaimonic well being resilience emerges from natural well being processes e g autonomy purpose in life environmental mastery and underlying genetic and neural substrates and acts as a protective resilient factor across life span transitions health systems this also reflects the broaden and build theory where there is a reciprocal relationship between trait resilience and positive health functioning through the promotion of feeling capable to deal with adverse health situations mixed model a mixed model of resilience can be derived from direct and proxy measures of resilience a search for latent factors among 61 direct and proxy resilience assessments suggested four main factors recovery resilience scales that focus on recovery such as engineering resilience align with reports of stability in emotional and health systems the most fitting theoretical framework for this is the broaden and build theory of positive emotions this theory highlights how positive emotions can foster resilient health systems and enable individuals to recover from setbacks sustainability resilience scales that reflect sustainability such as engineering resilience align with conscientiousness lower levels of dysexecutive functioning and five dimensions of eudaimonic well being theoretically resilience is the effective use of executive functions and processing of experiential demands also known as resilient functioning where an overarching cognitive mapping system integrates information from current situations prior experience and goal driven processes known as the cognitive model of resilience adaptability resilience resilience scales that assess adaptability such as adaptive capacity are associated with higher levels of extraversion such as being enthusiastic talkative assertive and gregarious and openness to experience such as being intellectually curious creative and imaginative these personality factors are often reported to form a higher order factor known as beta or plasticity which reflects a drive for growth agency and reduced inhibition by preferring new and diverse experiences while reducing fixed patterns of behavior these findings suggest that adaptability can be seen as a complement to growth agency and reduced inhibition social cohesion several resilience measures converge to suggest an underlying social cohesion factor in which social support care and cohesion among family and friends as featured in various scales within the literature form a single latent factor these findings point to the possibility of adopting a mixed model of resilience in which direct assessments of resilience could be employed alongside cognate psychological measures to improve the evaluation of resilience criticism as with other psychological phenomena there is controversy about how resilience should be defined its definition affects research focuses differing or imprecise definitions lead to inconsistent research research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected there is also disagreement among researchers as to whether psychological resilience is a character trait or state of being psychological resilience has also been referred to as ecological concept ranging from micro to macro levels of interpretation however it is generally agreed upon that resilience is a buildable resource there is also evidence that resilience can indicate a capacity to resist a sharp decline in other harm even though a person temporarily appears to get worse adolescents who have a high level of adaptation i e resilience tend to struggle with dealing with other psychological problems later on in life this is due to an overload of their stress response systems there is evidence that the higher one s resilience is the lower one s vulnerability brad evans and julian reid criticize resilience discourse and its rising popularity in their book resilient life the authors assert that policies of resilience can put the onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts tied to the emergence of neoliberalism climate change third world development and other discourses evans and reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards self responsibility and healthy psychological effects such as post traumatic growth see also references further reading external links national resilience resource center research on resilience at dalhousie university", "Feminism": "feminism is a range of socio political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political economic personal and social equality of the sexes feminism holds the position that modern societies are patriarchal they prioritize the male point of view and that women are treated unjustly in these societies efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational professional and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women originating in late 18th century europe feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women s rights including the right to vote run for public office work earn equal pay own property receive education enter into contracts have equal rights within marriage and maternity leave feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from sexual assault sexual harassment and domestic violence changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for women have also been part of feminist movements many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women s rights particularly in the west where they are near universally credited with achieving women s suffrage gender neutral language reproductive rights for women including access to contraceptives and abortion and the right to enter into contracts and own property although feminist advocacy is and has been mainly focused on women s rights some argue for the inclusion of men s liberation within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles feminist theory which emerged from feminist movements aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women s social roles and lived experiences feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years representing different viewpoints and political aims traditionally since the 19th century first wave liberal feminism which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework was contrasted with labour based proletarian women s movements that over time developed into socialist and marxist feminism based on class struggle theory since the 1960s both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate patriarchy liberal socialist and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the big three schools of feminist thought since the late 20th century many newer forms of feminism have emerged some forms such as white feminism and gender critical feminism have been criticized as taking into account only white middle class college educated heterosexual or cisgender perspectives these criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism such as black feminism and intersectional feminism history terminology mary wollstonecraft is seen by many as a founder of feminism due to her 1792 book titled a vindication of the rights of woman in which she argues that class and private property are the basis of discrimination against women and that women as much as men needed equal rights charles fourier a utopian socialist and french philosopher is credited with having coined the word f\u00e9minisme in 1837 but no trace of the word have been found in his works the word f\u00e9minisme feminism first appeared in france in 1871 in a medicine thesis about men suffering from tuberculosis and having developed according to the author ferdinand val\u00e8re faneau de la cour feminine traits the word f\u00e9ministe feminist inspired by its medical use was coined by alexandre dumas fils in a 1872 essay referring to men who supported women rights in both cases the use of the word was very negative and reflected a criticism of a so called confusion of the sexes by women who refused to abide by the sexual division of society and challenged the inequalities between sexes the concepts appeared in the netherlands in 1872 great britain in the 1890s and the united states in 1910 the oxford english dictionary dates the first appearance in english in this meaning back to 1895 depending on the historical moment culture and country feminists around the world have had different causes and goals most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women s rights should be considered feminist movements even when they did not or do not apply the term to themselves other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants those historians use the label protofeminist to describe earlier movements waves the history of the modern western feminist movement is divided into multiple waves the first comprised women s suffrage movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries promoting women s right to vote the second wave the women s liberation movement began in the 1960s and campaigned for legal and social equality for women in or around 1992 a third wave was identified characterized by a focus on individuality and diversity additionally some have argued for the existence of a fourth wave starting around 2012 which has used social media to combat sexual harassment violence against women and rape culture it is best known for the me too movement 19th and early 20th centuries first wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the uk and us it focused on the promotion of equal contract marriage parenting and property rights for women new legislation included the custody of infants act 1839 in the uk which introduced the tender years doctrine for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time other legislation such as the married women s property act 1870 in the uk and extended in the 1882 act became models for similar legislation in other british territories victoria passed legislation in 1884 and new south wales in 1889 the remaining australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897 with the turn of the 19th century activism focused primarily on gaining political power particularly the right of women s suffrage though some feminists were active in campaigning for women s sexual reproductive and economic rights too women s suffrage the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office began in britain s australasian colonies at the end of the 19th century with the self governing colony of new zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893 south australia followed suit with the constitutional amendment adult suffrage act 1894 in 1894 this was followed by australia granting female suffrage in 1902 in britain the suffragettes and suffragists campaigned for the women s vote as well as served the government and increase military enlistment by participating in the white feather campaign in 1918 the representation of the people act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property in 1928 this was extended to all women over 21 emmeline pankhurst was the most notable activist in england time named her one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century stating she shaped an idea of women for our time she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back in the us notable leaders of this movement included lucretia mott elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery before championing women s right to vote these women were influenced by the quaker theology of spiritual equality which asserts that men and women are equal under god they were also influenced by earlier american feminist thought leaders judith sargent murray john neal sarah moore grimk\u00e9 and margaret fuller in the us first wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution 1919 granting women the right to vote in all states the term first wave was coined retroactively when the term second wave feminism came into use in germany feminists like clara zetkin was very interested in women s politics including the fight for equal opportunities and women s suffrage through socialism she helped to develop the social democratic women s movement in germany from 1891 to 1917 she edited the spd women s newspaper die gleichheit equality in 1907 she became the leader of the newly founded women s office at the spd she also contributed to international women s day iwd during the late qing period and reform movements such as the hundred days reform chinese feminists called for women s liberation from traditional roles and neo confucian gender segregation later the chinese communist party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved women s liberation according to nawar al hassan golley arab feminism was closely connected with arab nationalism in 1899 qasim amin considered the father of arab feminism wrote the liberation of women which argued for legal and social reforms for women he drew links between women s position in egyptian society and nationalism leading to the development of cairo university and the national movement in 1923 hoda shaarawi founded the egyptian feminist union became its president and a symbol of the arab women s rights movement the iranian constitutional revolution in 1905 triggered the iranian women s movement which aimed to achieve women s equality in education marriage careers and legal rights however during the iranian revolution of 1979 many of the rights that women had gained from the women s movement were systematically abolished such as the family protection law mid 20th century by the mid 20th century women still lacked significant rights in france women obtained the right to vote only with the provisional government of the french republic of 21 april 1944 the consultative assembly of algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 march 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by fernard grenier they were given full citizenship including the right to vote grenier s proposition was adopted 51 to 16 in may 1947 following the november 1946 elections the sociologist robert verdier minimized the gender gap stating in le populaire that women had not voted in a consistent way dividing themselves as men according to social classes during the baby boom period feminism waned in importance wars both world war i and world war ii had seen the provisional emancipation of some women but post war periods signalled the return to conservative roles in switzerland women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971 but in the canton of appenzell innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991 when the canton was forced to do so by the federal supreme court of switzerland in liechtenstein women were given the right to vote by the women s suffrage referendum of 1984 three prior referendums held in 1968 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women s right to vote feminists continued to campaign for the reform of family laws which gave husbands control over their wives although by the 20th century coverture had been abolished in the uk and us married women in many continental european countries still had very few rights for instance in france married women did not receive the right to work without their husband s permission until 1965 feminists have also worked to abolish the marital exemption in rape laws which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives earlier efforts by first wave feminists such as voltairine de cleyre victoria woodhull and elizabeth clarke wolstenholme elmy to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed this was only achieved a century later in most western countries but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world french philosopher simone de beauvoir provided a marxist solution and an existentialist view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of the second sex in 1949 the book expressed feminists sense of injustice second wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present as such it coexists with third wave feminism second wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage such as ending gender discrimination second wave feminists see women s cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures the feminist activist and author carol hanisch coined the slogan the personal is political which became synonymous with the second wave second and third wave feminism in china has been characterized by a reexamination of women s roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements and new discussions about whether women s equality has actually been fully achieved in 1956 president gamal abdel nasser of egypt initiated state feminism which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted women s suffrage but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders during sadat s presidency his wife jehan sadat publicly advocated further women s rights though egyptian policy and society began to move away from women s equality with the new islamist movement and growing conservatism however some activists proposed a new feminist movement islamic feminism which argues for women s equality within an islamic framework in latin america revolutions brought changes in women s status in countries such as nicaragua where feminist ideology during the sandinista revolution aided women s quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change in 1963 betty friedan s book the feminine mystique helped voice the discontent that american women felt the book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second wave feminism in the united states within ten years women made up over half the first world workforce in 1970 australian writer germaine greer published the female eunuch which became a worldwide bestseller reportedly driving up divorce rates late 20th and early 21st centuries third wave feminism third wave feminism is traced to the emergence of the riot grrrl feminist punk subculture in olympia washington in the early 1990s and to anita hill s televised testimony in 1991 to an all male all white senate judiciary committee that clarence thomas nominated for the supreme court of the united states had sexually harassed her the term third wave is credited to rebecca walker who responded to thomas s appointment to the supreme court with an article in ms magazine becoming the third wave 1992 she wrote so i write this as a plea to all women especially women of my generation let thomas confirmation serve to remind you as it did me that the fight is far from over let this dismissal of a woman s experience move you to anger turn that outrage into political power do not vote for them unless they work for us do not have sex with them do not break bread with them do not nurture them if they don t prioritize our freedom to control our bodies and our lives i am not a post feminism feminist i am the third wave third wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave s essentialist definitions of femininity which third wave feminists argued overemphasized the experiences of upper middle class white women third wave feminists often focused on micro politics and challenged the second wave s paradigm as to what was or was not good for women and tended to use a post structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality feminist leaders rooted in the second wave such as gloria anzald\u00faa bell hooks chela sandoval cherr\u00ede moraga audre lorde maxine hong kingston and many other non white feminists sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race related subjectivities third wave feminism also contained internal debates between difference feminists who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning standpoint theory standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a person s social position influences their knowledge this perspective argues that research and theory treat women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased since the 1980s standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues such as rape incest and prostitution and culturally specific issues such as female genital mutilation in some parts of africa and arab societies as well as glass ceiling practices that impede women s advancement in developed economies in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism homophobia classism and colonization in a matrix of domination fourth wave feminism fourth wave feminism is a proposed extension of third wave feminism which corresponds to a resurgence in interest in feminism beginning around 2012 and associated with the use of social media according to feminist scholar prudence chamberlain the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women its essence she writes is incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist fourth wave feminism is defined by technology according to kira cochrane and is characterized particularly by the use of facebook twitter instagram youtube tumblr and blogs such as feministing to challenge misogyny and further gender equality issues that fourth wave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment campus sexual assault and rape culture scandals involving the harassment abuse and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement these have included the 2012 delhi gang rape 2012 jimmy savile allegations the bill cosby allegations 2014 isla vista killings 2016 trial of jian ghomeshi 2017 harvey weinstein allegations and subsequent weinstein effect and the 2017 westminster sexual scandals examples of fourth wave feminist campaigns include the everyday sexism project no more page 3 stop bild sexism mattress performance 10 hours of walking in nyc as a woman yesallwomen free the nipple one billion rising the 2017 women s march the 2018 women s march and the metoo movement in december 2017 time magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the metoo movement dubbed the silence breakers as person of the year decolonial feminism decolonial feminism reformulates the coloniality of gender by critiquing the very formation of gender and its subsequent formations of patriarchy and the gender binary not as universal constants across cultures but as structures that have been instituted by and for the benefit of european colonialism mar\u00eca lugones proposes that decolonial feminism speaks to how the colonial imposition of gender cuts across questions of ecology economics government relations with the spirit world and knowledge as well as across everyday practices that either habituate us to take care of the world or to destroy it decolonial feminists like karla jessen williamson and rauna kuokkanen have examined colonialism as a force that has imposed gender hierarchies on indigenous women that have disempowered and fractured indigenous communities and ways of life postfeminism the term postfeminism is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s while not being anti feminist postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals the term was first used to describe a backlash against second wave feminism but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave s ideas other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today s society amelia jones has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second wave feminism as a monolithic entity dorothy chunn describes a blaming narrative under the postfeminist moniker where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a post feminist society where gender equality has already been achieved according to chunn many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them theory feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields it encompasses work in a variety of disciplines including anthropology sociology economics women s studies literary criticism art history psychoanalysis and philosophy feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics power relations and sexuality while providing a critique of these social and political relations much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women s rights and interests themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination stereotyping objectification especially sexual objectification oppression and patriarchy in the field of literary criticism elaine showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases the first she calls feminist critique in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena the second showalter calls gynocriticism in which the woman is producer of textual meaning the last phase she calls gender theory in which the ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex gender system are explored this was paralleled in the 1970s by french feminists who developed the concept of \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine which translates as female or feminine writing h\u00e9l\u00e8ne cixous argues that writing and philosophy are phallocentric and along with other french feminists such as luce irigaray emphasize writing from the body as a subversive exercise the work of julia kristeva a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher and bracha ettinger artist and psychoanalyst has influenced feminist theory in general and feminist literary criticism in particular however as the scholar elizabeth wright points out none of these french feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the anglophone world movements and ideologies many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years feminism is often divided into three main traditions called liberal radical and socialist marxist feminism sometimes known as the big three schools of feminist thought since the late 20th century newer forms of feminisms have also emerged some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree or focus on specific topics such as the environment liberal feminism liberal feminism also known under other names such as reformist mainstream or historically as bourgeois feminism arose from 19th century first wave feminism and was historically linked to 19th century liberalism and progressivism while 19th century conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and legal reform within a liberal democratic framework without radically altering the structure of society liberal feminism works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure during the 19th and early 20th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on women s suffrage and access to education former norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal norwegian association for women s rights karin maria bruzelius has described liberal feminism as a realistic sober practical feminism susan wendell argues that liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as mary wollstonecraft and john stuart mill but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist reject major components of liberalism in a modern or party political sense she highlights equality of opportunity as a defining feature of liberal feminism liberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives some historically liberal branches are equality feminism social feminism equity feminism difference feminism individualist libertarian feminism and some forms of state feminism particularly the state feminism of the nordic countries the broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism for example libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality in fact it opposes such measures in contrast liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them catherine rottenberg notes that the raison d \u00eatre of classic liberal feminism was to pose an immanent critique of liberalism revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracy s proclamation of universal equality particularly with respect to the law institutional access and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern neoliberal feminism which seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order according to zhang and rios liberal feminism tends to be adopted by mainstream i e middle class women who do not disagree with the current social structure they found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and default form of feminism some modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as conservative in relative terms this is particularly the case for libertarian feminism which conceives of people as self owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference radical feminism radical feminism arose from the radical wing of second wave feminism and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy it considers the male controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women s oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships lesbian feminism is thus closely related other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist materialist ideologies rosemary hennessy and chrys ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of western marxist thought and have inspired a number of different but overlapping movements all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology s relationship to women marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women s oppression and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies socialist feminism distinguishes itself from marxist feminism by arguing that women s liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women s oppression anarcha feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy which comes from involuntary hierarchy other modern feminisms ecofeminism ecofeminists see men s control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature black and postcolonial ideologies sara ahmed argues that black and postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge to some of the organizing premises of western feminist thought during much of its history feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middle class white women from western europe and north america however women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms this trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the united states and the end of western european colonialism in africa the caribbean parts of latin america and southeast asia since that time women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of color or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle class postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless third world feminism and indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism these ideas also correspond with ideas in african feminism motherism stiwanism negofeminism femalism transnational feminism and africana womanism social constructionist ideologies in the late 20th century various feminists began to argue that gender roles are socially constructed and that it is impossible to generalize women s experiences across cultures and histories post structural feminism draws on the philosophies of post structuralism and deconstruction in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through discourse postmodern feminists also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality however as pamela abbott et al write a postmodern approach to feminism highlights the existence of multiple truths rather than simply men and women s standpoints transgender people third wave feminists tend to view the struggle for trans rights as an integral part of intersectional feminism fourth wave feminists also tend to be trans inclusive the american national organization for women now president terry o neill said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue and now has affirmed that trans women are women trans girls are girls several studies have found that people who identify as feminists tend to be more accepting of trans people than those who do not an ideology variously known as trans exclusionary radical feminism or its acronym terf or gender critical feminism is critical of concepts of gender identity and transgender rights holding that biological sex characteristics are an immutable determination of gender or supersede the importance of gender identity that trans women are not women and that trans men are not men these views have been described as transphobic by many other feminists cultural movements riot grrrls took an anti corporate stance of self sufficiency and self reliance riot grrrl s emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second wave feminism than with the third wave the movement encouraged and made adolescent girls standpoints central allowing them to express themselves fully lipstick feminism is a cultural feminist movement that attempts to respond to the backlash of second wave radical feminism of the 1960s and 1970s by reclaiming symbols of feminine identity such as make up suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure as valid and empowering personal choices demographics according to 2014 ipsos poll covering 15 developed countries 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists and 87 percent agreed that women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency not their gender however only 55 percent of women agreed that they have full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations taken together these studies reflect the importance differentiating between claiming a feminist identity and holding feminist attitudes or beliefs according to a 2015 poll 18 percent of americans use the label of feminist to describe themselves while 85 percent are feminists in practice as they reported they believe in equality for women the poll found that 52 percent did not identify as feminist 26 percent were unsure and 4 percent provided no response sociological research shows that in the us increased educational attainment is associated with greater support for feminist issues in addition politically liberal people are more likely to support feminist ideals compared to those who are conservative according to a 2016 survation poll for the fawcett society 7 percent of britons use the label of feminist to describe themselves while 83 percent say they support equality of opportunity for women this included higher support from men 86 than women 81 sexuality feminist views on sexuality vary and have differed by historical period and by cultural context feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions matters such as the sex industry sexual representation in the media and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists this debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars which pitted anti pornography feminism against sex positive feminism and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s over the course of the 1970s a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism sex industry opinions on the sex industry are diverse feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment alternately feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and reflect a woman s right to control and define her own sexuality feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression and a legitimate career similarly feminists views on prostitution vary ranging from critical to supportive affirming female sexual autonomy for feminists a woman s right to control her own sexuality is a key issue and one that is heavily contested between different branches of feminism radical feminists such as catharine mackinnon argue that women have very little control over their own bodies with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies radical feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances some radical feminists have argued that women should not engage in heterosexual sex and choose lesbianism as a lifestyle and political choice a view that has fallen out of favor as sexuality is seen as largely biologically influenced rather than a choice one can make for political reasons some radical feminists argue that all cultures are in one way or another dominated by ideologies that deny women s right to sexual expression because men under a patriarchy define sex on their own terms this entitlement can take different forms depending on the culture in some conservative and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times virtually without limit thus forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour in 1968 radical feminist anne koedt argued in her essay the myth of the vaginal orgasm that women s biology and the clitoral orgasm had not been properly analyzed and popularized because men have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina and not the clitoral area other branches of feminism such as individualist feminism consider themselves sex positive and see women s expression of their own sexuality as a right in this view what is or is not degrading is subjective and each person has a right to decide for themselves what sexual acts they find degrading and if they want to participate in them or not individualist feminist wendy mcelroy wrote in her book xxx a woman s right to pornography let s examine the idea that pornography is degrading to women degrading is a subjective term personally i find detergent commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading to women i find movies in which prostitutes are treated like ignorant drug addicts to be slander against women every woman has the right the need to define degradation for herself according to this view part of sexual autonomy is the right to define one s boundaries desires and limits around their sexuality rather than accept a narrative in which all women are victims of men during a sex act science sandra harding says that the moral and political insights of the women s movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds some feminists such as ruth hubbard and evelyn fox keller criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective a part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions physicist lisa randall appointed to a task force at harvard by then president lawrence summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering said i just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don t have to come up anymore lynn hankinson nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women thus they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women and to uncover the consequences of omitting misdescribing or devaluing them to account for a range of human experience another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions furthermore despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality one criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings susan haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women s thinking as intuitive and emotional etc meera nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy biology and gender modern feminism challenges the essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic for example anne fausto sterling s book myths of gender explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender in delusions of gender cordelia fine disputes scientific evidence that suggests that there is an innate biological difference between men s and women s minds asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences feminist psychology feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects as women earned doctorates in psychology women and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study feminist psychology emphasizes social context lived experience and qualitative analysis projects such as psychology s feminist voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline culture design there is a long history of feminist activity in design disciplines like industrial design graphic design and fashion design this work has explored topics like beauty diy feminine approaches to design and community based projects some iconic writing includes cheryl buckley s essays on design and patriarchy and joan rothschild s design and feminism re visioning spaces places and everyday things more recently isabel prochner s research explored how feminist perspectives can support positive change in industrial design helping to identify systemic social problems and inequities in design and guiding socially sustainable and grassroots design solutions businesses feminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses including feminist bookstores credit unions presses mail order catalogs and restaurants these businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s visual arts corresponding with general developments within feminism and often including such self organizing tactics as the consciousness raising group the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s jeremy strick director of the museum of contemporary art in los angeles described the feminist art movement as the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period and peggy phelan says that it brought about the most far reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades feminist artist judy chicago who created the dinner party a set of vulva themed ceramic plates in the 1970s said in 2009 to artnews there is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male eurocentric narrative we are trying to change the future to get girls and boys to realize that women s art is not an exception it s a normal part of art history a feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn giving voice to the ways contemporary female artists are dealing with gender social media and the notion of embodiment literature the feminist movement produced feminist fiction feminist non fiction and feminist poetry which created new interest in women s writing it also prompted a general reevaluation of women s historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women s lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest there has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women in western feminist literary scholarship studies like dale spender s mothers of the novel 1986 and jane spencer s the rise of the woman novelist 1986 were ground breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest various presses began the task of reissuing long out of print texts virago press began to publish its large list of 19th and early 20th century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation in the 1980s pandora press responsible for publishing spender s study issued a companion line of 18th century novels written by women more recently broadview press continues to issue 18th and 19th century novels many hitherto out of print and the university of kentucky has a series of republications of early women s novels particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts a vindication of the rights of woman 1792 by mary wollstonecraft is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy a room of one s own 1929 by virginia woolf is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy the widespread interest in women s writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon interest in post colonial literatures gay and lesbian literature writing by people of colour working people s writing and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered literature and genres hitherto not regarded as literary such as children s writing journals letters travel writing and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest most genres and subgenres have undergone a similar analysis so literary studies have entered new territories such as the female gothic or women s science fiction according to elyce rae helford science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought particularly as bridges between theory and practice feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender notable texts of this kind are ursula k le guin s the left hand of darkness 1969 joanna russ the female man 1970 octavia butler s kindred 1979 and margaret atwood s handmaid s tale 1985 feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women s lived experiences for example maya angelou s i know why the caged bird sings was extremely influential as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the united states in addition many feminist movements have embraced poetry as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies poetry collections and public readings moreover historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what women s lives were like in the past while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities an important figure in the history of women s literature is hrotsvitha c 935 973 a canoness who was an early female poet in the german lands as a historian hrotsvitha is one of the few writers to address women s lives from a woman s perspective during the middle ages hrotsvitha s six short dramas are considered to be her magnum opus she has been called the most remarkable woman of her time and an important figure in the history of women music women s music or womyn s music or wimmin s music is the music by women for women and about women the genre emerged as a musical expression of the second wave feminist movement as well as the labour civil rights and peace movements the movement was started by lesbians such as cris williamson meg christian and margie adam african american women activists such as bernice johnson reagon and her group sweet honey in the rock and peace activist holly near women s music also refers to the wider industry of women s music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians producers sound engineers technicians cover artists distributors promoters and festival organizers who are also women feminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the 1980s as part of the new musicology prior to this in the 1970s musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers and had begun to review concepts of canon genius genre and periodization from a feminist perspective in other words the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked through the 1980s and 1990s this trend continued as musicologists like susan mcclary marcia citron and ruth solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work concepts such as music as gendered discourse professionalism reception of women s music examination of the sites of music production relative wealth and education of women popular music studies in relation to women s identity patriarchal ideas in music analysis and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time while the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles women are much less likely to have positions of authority such as being the leader of an orchestra in popular music while there are many women singers recording songs there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers the individuals who direct and manage the recording process cinema feminist cinema advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives arose largely with the development of feminist film theory in the late 1960s and early 1970s women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness raising groups and set about analysing from different perspectives dominant cinema s construction of women 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the u s and u k as well as the first feminist film journal women film trailblazers from this period included claire johnston and laura mulvey who also organized the women s event at the edinburgh film festival other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include teresa de lauretis anneke smelik and kaja silverman approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism feminist independent film and feminist distribution it has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking deconstruction concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema the second approach a feminist counterculture embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language bracha l ettinger invented a field of notions and concepts that serve the research of cinema from feminine perspective the matrixial gaze ettinger s language include original concepts to discover feminine perspectives many writers in the fields of film theory and contemporary art are using the ettingerian matrixial sphere matricial sphere during the 1930s 1950s heyday of the big hollywood studios the status of women in the industry was abysmal since then female directors such as sally potter catherine breillat claire denis and jane campion have made art movies and directors like kathryn bigelow and patty jenkins have had mainstream success this progress stagnated in the 1990s and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles politics feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the 20th century socialism since the late 19th century some feminists have allied with socialism whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women s rights august bebel an early activist of the german social democratic party spd published his work die frau und der sozialismus juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general in 1907 there was an international conference of socialist women in stuttgart where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle clara zetkin of the spd called for women s suffrage to build a socialist order the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women s question in britain the women s movement was allied with the labour party in the u s betty friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership radical women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the u s and is still active during the spanish civil war dolores ib\u00e1rruri la pasionaria led the communist party of spain although she supported equal rights for women she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the anarcha feminist mujeres libres feminists in ireland in the early 20th century included the revolutionary irish republican suffragette and socialist constance markievicz who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the british house of commons however in line with sinn f\u00e9in abstentionist policy she would not take her seat in the house of commons she was re elected to the second d\u00e1il in the elections of 1921 she was also a commander of the irish citizens army which was led by the socialist and self described feminist irish leader james connolly during the 1916 easter rising fascism fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women s groups amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all italian citizens of age 18 and above including women accomplished only in 1946 after the defeat of fascism and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25 this demand was particularly championed by special fascist women s auxiliary groups such as the fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925 under pressure from dictator benito mussolini s more conservative coalition partners cyprian blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of adolf hitler feminism has a complicated relationship with the nazi movement as well while nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women they claimed to recognize women s equality in employment however hitler and mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism and after the rise of nazism in germany in 1933 there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre war period and to some extent during the 1920s georges duby et al write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility with women maintaining a largely subordinate position blamires also writes that neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept their traditional roles civil rights movement and anti racism the civil rights movement has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa many american feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women s rights and the rights of non white people despite the connections between the women s and civil rights movements some tensions arose during the late 1960s and the 1970s as non white women argued that feminism was predominantly white straight and middle class and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality similarly some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and homophobic elements and did not adequately address minority women s concerns these criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of racism classism and sexism they also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and chicana feminism in addition to making large contributions to lesbian feminism and other integrations of queer of color identity neoliberalism neoliberalism has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe especially in the global south masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking 177 women s experiences in non industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone 175 proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women s participation in the workforce there will be heightened economic progress but feminist critics have stated that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations 186 98 neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labor the structural privileging of men and masculinity and the politicization of women s subordination in the family and the workplace 176 the feminization of employment refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labor conditions that are less desirable meaningful safe and secure 179 employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labor and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding docile and willing to accept low wages 180 social constructs about feminized labor have played a big part in this for instance employers often perpetuate ideas about women as secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion 189 societal impact the feminist movement has effected change in western society including women s suffrage greater access to education more equal payment to men the right to initiate divorce proceedings the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy including access to contraceptives and abortion and the right to own property civil rights from the 1960s on the campaign for women s rights was met with mixed results in the u s and the u k other countries of the eec agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the european community some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to child sexual abuse the view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men s responsibility for their own conduct the men being adults in the u s the national organization for women now began in 1966 to seek women s equality including through the equal rights amendment era which did not pass although some states enacted their own reproductive rights in the u s centred on the court decision in roe v wade enunciating a woman s right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term the division of labor within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century sociologist arlie russell hochschild found that in two career couples men and women on average spend about equal amounts of time working but women still spend more time on housework although cathy young responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting judith k brown writes women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics the participant is not obliged to be far from home the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration and the work is not dangerous can be performed in spite of interruptions and is easily resumed once interrupted in international law the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw is an international convention adopted by the united nations general assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women it came into force in those nations ratifying it jurisprudence feminist jurisprudence is a branch of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law it addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society s universal gender neutral ideals feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women s values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience language proponents of gender neutral language argue that the use of gender specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society according to the handbook of english linguistics generic masculine pronouns and gender specific job titles are instances where english linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species merriam webster chose feminism as its 2017 word of the year noting that word of the year is a quantitative measure of interest in a particular word theology feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions practices scriptures and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities reinterpreting male dominated imagery and language about god determining women s place in relation to career and motherhood and studying images of women in the religion s sacred texts christian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand christianity in light of the equality of women and men and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of christianity while there is no standard set of beliefs among christian feminists most agree that god does not discriminate on the basis of sex and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women male dominance and the balance of parenting in christian marriage claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men and the overall treatment of women in the church islamic feminists advocate women s rights gender equality and social justice grounded within an islamic framework advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of islamic teaching through the quran hadith sayings of muhammad and sharia law towards the creation of a more equal and just society although rooted in islam the movement s pioneers have also used secular and western feminist discourses and recognize the role of islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement buddhist feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious legal and social status of women within buddhism it is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally socially spiritually and in leadership from a buddhist perspective the buddhist feminist rita gross describes buddhist feminism as the radical practice of the co humanity of women and men jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious legal and social status of women within judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for jewish women the main issues for early jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all male prayer group or minyan the exemption from positive time bound mitzvot and women s inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce many jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history secular or atheist feminists have engaged in feminist criticism of religion arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and misogynistic themes and elements in religious texts patriarchy patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures in this system fathers have authority over women children and property it implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women carole pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection in feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society separatism is the only viable solution other feminists have criticized these views as being anti men men and masculinity feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality the social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations patriarchal cultures are criticized for limiting forms of masculinity available to men and thus narrowing their life choices some feminists are engaged with men s issues activism such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men male participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality many male feminists and pro feminists are active in both women s rights activism feminist theory and masculinity studies however some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations the consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism reactions different groups of people have responded to feminism and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics among american university students for both men and women support for feminist ideas is more common than self identification as a feminist the us media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists are less often associated with day to day work leisure activities of regular women however as recent research has demonstrated as people are exposed to self identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism their own self identification with feminism increases pro feminism pro feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement the term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism the activities of pro feminist men s groups include anti violence work with boys and young men in schools offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces running community education campaigns and counselling male perpetrators of violence pro feminist men also may be involved in men s health activism against pornography including anti pornography legislation men s studies and the development of gender equity curricula in schools this work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women s services such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres anti feminism and criticism of feminism anti feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms in the 19th century anti feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women s suffrage later opponents of women s entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women other anti feminists opposed women s entry into the labour force or their right to join unions to sit on juries or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs some anti feminists argue for example that social acceptance of divorce and non married women is wrong and harmful and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained other anti feminists oppose women s entry into the workforce political office and the voting process as well as the lessening of male authority in families writers such as camille paglia christina hoff sommers jean bethke elshtain elizabeth fox genovese and daphne patai oppose some forms of feminism though they identify as feminists they argue for example that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women s interests above men s and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women daphne patai and noretta koertge argue that the term anti feminist is used to silence academic debate about feminism a meta analysis in 2023 published in the journal psychology of women quarterly investigated the stereotype of feminists attitudes to men and concluded that feminist views of men were no different to that of non feminists or men towards men and titled the phenomenon the misandry myth based on evidence that it is false and widespread secular humanism secular humanism is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma pseudoscience and superstition critics of feminism sometimes ask why feminism and not humanism some humanists argue however that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap and the distinction is only in motivation for example a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion in this respect it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism humanism played a significant role in protofeminism during the renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women popular figures despite the challenge of the patriarchal organization of society see also

also known as lgbtq pride lgbtqia pride lgbt pride queer pride or gay and lesbian pride is the promotion of the rights self affirmation dignity equality and increased visibility of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer lgbtq people as a social group pride as opposed to shame and social stigma is the predominant outlook that bolsters most lgbtq rights movements pride has lent its name to lgbtq themed organizations institutes foundations book titles periodicals a cable tv channel and the pride library ranging from solemn to carnivalesque pride events are typically held during lgbtq pride month or some other period that commemorates a turning point in a country s lgbtq history for example moscow pride in may for the anniversary of russia s 1993 decriminalization of homosexuality some pride events include pride parades and marches rallies commemorations community days dance parties and festivals common symbols of pride include the rainbow flag and other pride flags the lowercase greek letter lambda \u03bb the pink triangle and the black triangle these latter two reclaimed from use as badges of shame in nazi concentration camps terminology origins in the earlier decades of the 20th century before the term pride became widely used gatherings and protests by the lgbtq community were often referred to as homophile demonstrations reflecting a more conservative and assimilationist approach to lgbtq rights as the movement became more radical in the late 1960s particularly after the stonewall uprising they were called gay liberation marches or rallies which emphasized demands for full equality and liberation the term gay pride was claimed to be coined either by jack baker and michael mcconnell an activist couple in minnesota or by thom higgins another gay rights activist in minnesota higgins a former member of the catholic church sought to combat the negative energy emanating from the institution higgins paired one of the seven deadly sins pride with gay due to the church s stance on same sex behaviors as going against divine and natural laws that language was transformative mcconnell said this approach not only opened doors but also propelled individuals forward in 1971 mcconnell introduced the term gay pride in chicago setting off a powerful movement brenda howard along with the bisexual activist robert a martin aka donny the punk and gay activist l craig schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word pride to describe these festivities historical background pride precursors karl heinrich ulrichs was one of the first openly gay activists and is considered a predecessor of the lgbt pride movement annual reminders the 1950s and 1960s in the united states constituted an extremely repressive legal and social period for lgbtq people in this context american homophile organizations such as the daughters of bilitis and the mattachine society coordinated some of the earliest demonstrations of the modern lgbt rights movement these two organizations in particular carried out pickets called annual reminders to inform and remind americans that lgbtq people did not receive basic civil rights protections annual reminders began in 1965 and took place each july 4 at independence hall in philadelphia gay is good the anti lgbt discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness inspired by stokely carmichael s black is beautiful gay civil rights pioneer and participant in the annual reminders frank kameny originated the slogan gay is good in the early 1960s to counter social stigma and personal feelings of guilt and shame christopher street liberation day early on the morning of saturday june 28 1969 lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons rioted following a police raid on the stonewall inn a gay bar at 43 christopher street in greenwich village manhattan new york city this riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in the modern lgbt rights movement and the impetus for organizing lgbt pride marches on a much larger public scale on november 2 1969 craig rodwell his partner fred sargeant ellen broidy and linda rhodes proposed the first pride march to be held in new york city by way of a resolution at the eastern regional conference of homophile organizations ercho meeting in philadelphia that the annual reminder in order to be more relevant reach a greater number of people and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged that of our fundamental human rights be moved both in time and location we propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last saturday in june in new york city to commemorate the 1969 spontaneous demonstrations on christopher street and this demonstration be called christopher street liberation day no dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration we also propose that we contact homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day we propose a nationwide show of support all attendees to the ercho meeting in philadelphia voted for the march except for mattachine society of new york which abstained members of the gay liberation front glf attended the meeting and were seated as guests of rodwell s group homophile youth movement in neighborhoods hymn meetings to organize the march began in early january at rodwell s apartment in 350 bleecker street at first there was difficulty getting some of the major new york city organizations like gay activists alliance gaa to send representatives craig rodwell and his partner fred sargeant ellen broidy michael brown marty nixon and foster gunnison jr of mattachine made up the core group of the csld umbrella committee cslduc for initial funding gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors while sargeant solicited donations via the oscar wilde memorial bookshop customer mailing list and nixon worked to gain financial support from glf in his position as treasurer for that organization other mainstays of the organizing committee were judy miller jack waluska steve gerrie and brenda howard of glf believing that more people would turn out for the march on a sunday and so as to mark the date of the start of the stonewall uprising the cslduc scheduled the date for the first march for sunday june 28 1970 with dick leitsch s replacement as president of mattachine ny by michael kotis in april 1970 opposition to the march by mattachine ended christopher street liberation day on june 28 1970 marked the first anniversary of the stonewall riots with the march which was the first gay pride march in new york history and covered the 51 blocks to central park the march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers the new york times reported on the front page that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks reporting by the village voice was positive describing the out front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the stonewall inn one year ago there was also an assembly on christopher street spread on saturday june 27 1970 chicago gay liberation organized a march from washington square park bughouse square to the water tower at the intersection of michigan and chicago avenues which was the route originally planned and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the civic center now richard j daley plaza the date was chosen because the stonewall events began on the last saturday of june and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of michigan avenue shoppers subsequent chicago parades have been held on the last sunday of june coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere subsequently during the same weekend gay activist groups on the west coast of the united states held a march in los angeles and a march and gay in in san francisco the next year gay pride marches took place in boston dallas milwaukee london paris west berlin and stockholm by 1972 the participating cities included atlanta brighton buffalo detroit washington d c miami and philadelphia as well as san francisco frank kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the stonewall riots an organizer of gay activism in the 1950s he was used to persuasion trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different from themselves when he and other people marched in front of the white house the state department and independence hall five years earlier their objective was to look as if they could work for the u s government ten people marched with kameny then and they alerted no press to their intentions although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the annual reminder in 1969 he later observed by the time of stonewall we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country a year later there were at least fifteen hundred by two years later to the extent that a count could be made it was twenty five hundred similar to kameny s regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots randy wicker came to describe his embarrassment as one of the greatest mistakes of his life the image of gays retaliating against police after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals kay lahusen who photographed the marches in 1965 stated up to 1969 this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement many new activists consider the stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale 1980s and 1990s in the 1980s there was a major cultural shift in the stonewall riot commemorations the previous more loosely organized grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community the marches began dropping liberation and freedom from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community replacing them with the philosophy of gay pride in san francisco the name of the gay parade and celebration was not changed from gay freedom day parade to gay pride day parade until 1994 the greek lambda symbol and the pink triangle which had been revolutionary symbols of the gay liberation movement were tidied up and incorporated into the gay pride or pride movement providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings the pink triangle was also the inspiration for the homomonument in amsterdam commemorating all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality pride month pride month occurs in the united states to commemorate the stonewall riots which occurred at the end of june 1969 as a result many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact lgbtq people have had in the world three presidents of the united states have officially declared a pride month first president bill clinton declared june gay lesbian pride month in 1999 and 2000 then from 2009 to 2016 each year he was in office president barack obama declared june lgbt pride month later president joe biden declared june lgbtq pride month in 2021 donald trump became the first republican president to acknowledge lgbt pride month in 2019 but he did so through tweeting rather than an official proclamation the tweet was later released as an official statement from the president beginning in 2012 google displayed some lgbt related search results with different rainbow colored patterns each year during june in 2017 google also included rainbow coloured streets on google maps to display gay pride marches occurring across the world at many colleges which are not in session in june lgbt pride is instead celebrated during april which is dubbed gaypril pride month is not recognized internationally as pride celebrations take place in many other places at different times including in the months of february august and september in canada pride season refers to the wide array of pride events held from june to september 1 in other countries like the united states the month of june is recognized as pride month whereas in canada it s a full season for the first time in the history of an arab monarchy diplomatic embassies in the united arab emirates supported the lgbtq community by raising the rainbow flag to celebrate pride month 2021 the uk embassy in the uae posted a picture on twitter of the pride flag alongside the union jack affirming their pride in the uk s diversity and our values of equality inclusion and freedom the us embassy in the emirates also posted a picture of the flying american and pride flags on its abu dhabi residence stating that it supported dignity and equality of all people while the move was remarkable it faced backlash online and was extensively criticized by the locals over social media many called it disrespectful and insulting the term wrath month which started as a twitter meme in 2018 eventually came to be used by some as a response to the perceived tameness of pride month rainbow pride flag the rainbow flag also known as the pride flag is a symbol of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer lgbtq pride and social movements the most common variant consists of six horizontal stripes of red orange yellow green blue and violet designed in 1978 by artist gilbert baker the flag s colors were originally eight and had specific meanings in relation to the lgbt community the design has undergone revisions over the years but it remains a widely recognized symbol of lgbtq identity and activism criticism from both outside and inside the lgbt community there is criticism and protest against pride events bob christie s documentary beyond gay the politics of pride evaluates gay pride events in different countries within the context of local opposition initiatives and criticism by governments and political leaders brazil in august 2011 s\u00e3o paulo city alderman carlos apolin\u00e1rio of the right wing democrats party sponsored a bill to organize and sponsor heterosexual pride day on the third sunday of december apolin\u00e1rio an evangelical protestant stated that the intent of the parade was a struggle against excesses and privileges members of gay group of bahia and the workers party opposed the bill as enhancing the possibility of discrimination and prejudice the bill was nevertheless passed by the city council but never received the signature of mayor gilberto kassab a brazilian photographer was arrested after refusing to delete photos of police attacking two young people participating in a gay pride parade on october 16 2011 in the city of itabuna bahia reported the newspaper correio 24 horas according to the website not\u00edcias de ipiau ederivaldo benedito known as ben\u00e9 said four police officers tried to convince him to delete the photos soon after they realized they were being photographed when he refused they ordered him to turn over the camera when the photographer refused again the police charged him with contempt and held him in jail for over 21 hours until he gave a statement according to chief marlon macedo the police alleged that the photographer was interfering with their work did not have identification and became aggressive when he was asked to move ben\u00e9 denied the allegations saying the police were belligerent and that the scene was witnessed by over 300 people reported ag\u00eancia estado spain in a 2008 interview for the biography la reina muy cerca the queen up close by spanish journalist and writer pilar urbano queen sof\u00eda of spain sparked controversy by voicing her disapproval of lgbt pride this was in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the royal family by censoring the spanish law on marriage in how it names same sex unions as matrimonio marriage without using the slogan straight pride queen sof\u00eda was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the lgbt community does for gay pride parades that the former collective would bring madrid to a standstill even though the royal household of spain approved publication of the interview and pilar urbano offered to share the interview recording both queen sof\u00eda and the royal household have refuted the comments in question turkey in 2015 police dispersed the pride parade using tear gas and rubber bullets in 2016 and 2017 the istanbul governor s office did not allow the pride parade to take place citing security concerns and public order uganda in 2016 ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital homosexual acts are illegal in uganda in group in a special queer issue of the stranger in 1999 openly gay author pundit and journalist dan savage questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on lgbt people but that pride is now making lgbt people dull and slow as a group as well as being a constant reminder of shame however he also states that pride in some simpler forms is still useful to individuals struggling with shame savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an lgbt individual realizes the reality that sexual orientation does not say much about a person s personality after being led by the illusion that lgbt individuals are part of a co supportive and inherently good group of people the growth and commercialization of christopher street days coupled with their de politicization has led to an alternative csd in berlin the so called kreuzberger csd or transgenialer transgenial trans ingenious csd political party members are not invited for speeches nor can parties or companies sponsor floats after the parade there is a festival with a stage for political speakers and entertainers groups discuss lesbian transsexual transgender gay or queer perspectives on issues such as poverty and unemployment benefits hartz iv gentrification or fortress europe in june 2010 american philosopher and theorist judith butler refused the civil courage award zivilcouragepreis of the christopher street day parade in berlin germany at the award ceremony arguing and lamenting in a speech that the parade had become too commercial and was ignoring the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants according to butler even the organizers themselves promote racism the general manager of the csd committee robert kastl countered butler s allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counseling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006 regarding the allegations of commercialism kastl further explained that the csd organizers do not require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at 50 and goes up to 1500 he also distanced himself from all forms of racism and islamophobia some social movements and associations have criticized modern iterations of pride viewing it as a depletion of the claims of such demonstrations and the merchandization of the parade in this respect they defend in countries like spain the united states or canada a critical pride celebration to give the events a political meaning again gay shame a radical movement within the lgbt community opposes the assimilation of lgbt people into mainstream heteronormative society

photos by cbs news", "Personal identity": "personal identity is the unique numerical identity of a person over time discussions regarding personal identity typically aim to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the same person persisting through time in philosophy the problem of personal identity is concerned with how one is able to identify a single person over a time interval dealing with such questions as what makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time or what kinds of things are we persons in contemporary metaphysics the matter of personal identity is referred to as the diachronic problem of personal identity the synchronic problem concerns the question of what features and traits characterize a person at a given time analytic philosophy and continental philosophy both inquire about the nature of identity continental philosophy deals with conceptually maintaining identity when confronted by different philosophic propositions postulates and presuppositions about the world and its nature continuity of substance bodily substance one way to explain how persons persist over time is to say that identity consists in physical or bodily continuity however there are problems with this view as the ship of theseus thought experiment illustrates even for inanimate objects there are difficulties in determining whether one physical body at one time is the same thing as a physical body at another time with humans over time our bodies age and grow losing and gaining matter and over sufficient years will not consist of most of the matter they once consisted of it is thus problematic to ground the persistence of personal identity over time in the continuous existence of our bodies nevertheless this approach has its supporters who define humans as biological organisms they assert the proposition that a psychological relation is not necessary for personal continuity this personal identity ontology assumes the relational theory of life sustaining processes instead of bodily continuity the teletransportation problem proposed by derek parfit is designed to bring out intuitions about corporeal continuity the thought experiment discusses cases in which a person is teleported from earth to mars ultimately the inability to specify where on a spectrum the transmitted person stops being identical to the initial person on earth appears to show that having a numerically identical physical body is not the criterion for personal identity mental substance in another concept of mind the set of cognitive faculties are considered to consist of an immaterial substance separate from and independent of the body if a person is then identified with their mind rather than their body if a person is considered to be their mind and their mind is such a non physical substance then personal identity over time may be grounded in the persistence of this non physical substance despite the continuous change in the substance of the body it is associated with the mind body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship if any that exists between minds or mental processes and bodily states or processes one of the aims of philosophers who work in this area is to explain how a non material mind can influence a material body and vice versa this is controversial and problematic and adopting it as a solution raises questions perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in mental states ultimately causing sensation a desire for food for example will tend to cause a person to move their body in a manner and in a direction to obtain food the question then is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of an organ the human brain possessing electrochemical properties a related problem is to explain how propositional attitudes e g beliefs and desires can cause neurons of the brain to fire and muscles to contract in the correct manner these comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of ren\u00e9 descartes continuity of consciousness locke s conception john locke considered personal identity or the self to be founded on consciousness viz memory and not on the substance of either the soul or the body chapter 27 of book ii of his essay concerning human understanding 1689 entitled on identity and diversity has been said to be one of the first modern conceptualizations of consciousness as the repeated self identification of oneself through this identification moral responsibility could be attributed to the subject and punishment and guilt could be justified as critics such as nietzsche would point out according to locke personal identity the self depends on consciousness not on substance nor on the soul we are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of the past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of present thoughts and actions if consciousness is this thought which goes along with the substance which makes the same person then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness this may show us wherein personal identity consists not in the identity of substance but in the identity of consciousness for example one may claim to be a reincarnation of plato therefore having the same soul substance one would be the same person as plato only if one had the same consciousness of plato s thoughts and actions that he himself did therefore self identity is not based on the soul one soul may have various personalities neither is self identity founded on the body substance argues locke as the body may change while the person remains the same even the identity of animals is not founded on their body animal identity is preserved in identity of life and not of substance as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life on the other hand identity of humans is based on their consciousness this border case leads to this problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness and only oneself can be aware of one s consciousness exterior human judges may never know if they are really judging and punishing the same person or simply the same body in other words locke argues that one may be judged only for the acts of the body as this is what is apparent to all but god we are only responsible for the acts of which we are conscious this forms the basis of the insanity defense one cannot be held accountable for acts of which one was unconscious and therefore leads to philosophical questions personal identity consists not in the identity of substance but in the identity of consciousness wherein if socrates and the present mayor of queenborough agree they are the same person if the same socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of the same consciousness socrates waking and sleeping is not the same person and to punish socrates waking for what sleeping socrates thought and waking socrates was never conscious of would be no more right than to punish one twin for what his brother twin did whereof he knew nothing because their outsides were so like that they could not be distinguished for such twins have been seen or again person as i take it is the name for this self wherever a man finds what he calls himself there i think another may say is the same person it is a forensic term appropriating actions and their merit and so belong only to intelligent agents capable of a law and happiness and misery this personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past only by consciousness whereby it becomes concerned and accountable owns and imputes to itself past actions just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the present all which is founded in a concern for happiness the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness that which is conscious of pleasure and pain desiring that that self that is conscious should be happy and therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness it can be no more concerned in it than if they had never been done and to receive pleasure or pain i e reward or punishment on the account of any such action is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being without any demerit at all for supposing a man punished now for what he had done in another life whereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all what difference is there between that punishment and being created miserable and therefore conformable to this the apostle tells us that at the great day when every one shall receive according to his doings the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open the sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all person shall have that they themselves in what bodies soever they appear or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to are the same that committed those actions and deserve that punishment for them henceforth locke s conception of personal identity founds it not on the substance or the body but in the same continued consciousness which is also distinct from the soul since the soul may have no consciousness of itself as in reincarnation he creates a third term between the soul and the body for locke the body may change while consciousness remains the same therefore personal identity for locke is not in the body but in consciousness philosophical intuition bernard williams presents a thought experiment appealing to the intuitions about what it is to be the same person in the future the thought experiment consists of two approaches to the same experiment for the first approach williams suggests that suppose that there is some process by which subjecting two persons to it can result in the two persons have exchanged bodies the process has put into the body of person b the memories behavioral dispositions and psychological characteristics of the person who prior to undergoing the process belonged to person a and conversely with person b to show this one is to suppose that before undergoing the process person a and b are asked to which resulting person a body person or b body person they wish to receive a punishment and which a reward upon undergoing the process and receiving either the punishment or reward it appears to that a body person expresses the memories of choosing who gets which treatment as if that person was person b conversely with b body person this sort of approach to the thought experiment appears to show that since the person who expresses the psychological characteristics of person a to be person a then intuition is that psychological continuity is the criterion for personal identity the second approach is to suppose that someone is told that one will have memories erased and then one will be tortured does one need to be afraid of being tortured the intuition is that people will be afraid of being tortured since it will still be one despite not having one s memories next williams asked one to consider several similar scenarios intuition is that in all the scenarios one is to be afraid of being tortured that it is still one s self despite having one s memories erased and receiving new memories the last scenario is identical to the first in the first approach intuition is to show that one s psychological continuity is the criterion for personal identity but in second approach intuition is that it is one s bodily continuity that is the criterion for personal identity to resolve this conflict williams feels one s intuition in the second approach is stronger and if he was given the choice of distributing a punishment and a reward he would want his body person to receive the reward and the other body person to receive the punishment even if that other body person has his memories psychological continuity in psychology personal continuity also called personal persistence or self continuity is the uninterrupted connection concerning a particular person of their private life and personality personal continuity is the union affecting the facets arising from personality in order to avoid discontinuities from one moment of time to another time personal continuity is an important part of identity this is the process of ensuring that the qualities of the mind such as self awareness sentience sapience and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one s environment are consistent from one moment to the next personal continuity is the property of a continuous and connected period of time and is intimately related to do with a person s body or physical being in a single four dimensional continuum associationism a theory of how ideas combine in the mind allows events or views to be associated with each other in the mind thus leading to a form of learning associations can result from contiguity similarity or contrast through contiguity one associates ideas or events that usually happen to occur at the same time some of these events form an autobiographical memory in which each is a personal representation of the general or specific events and personal facts ego integrity is the psychological concept of the ego s accumulated assurance of its capacity for order and meaning ego identity is the accrued confidence that the inner sameness and continuity prepared in the past are matched by the sameness and continuity of one s meaning for others as evidenced in the promise of a career body and ego control organ expressions and of the other attributes of the dynamics of a physical system to face the emotions of ego death in circumstances which can summon sometimes anti theonymistic self abandonment identity continuum it has been argued from the nature of sensations and ideas that there is no such thing as a permanent identity daniel shapiro asserts that one of four major views on identity does not recognize a permanent identity and instead thinks of thoughts without a thinker a consciousness shell with drifting emotions and thoughts but no essence according to him this view is based on the buddhist concept of anatta a continuously evolving flow of awareness malcolm david eckel states that the self changes at every moment and has no permanent identity it is a constant process of changing or becoming a fluid ever changing self bundle theory of the self david hume undertook looking at the mind body problem hume also investigated a person s character the relationship between human and animal nature and the nature of agency hume pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago though we ve changed in many respects the same person appears present now as was present then we might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self hume denied a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features when we begin introspecting we always stumble on some particular perception or other i may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement it is plain that in the course of our thinking and in the constant revolution of our ideas our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association it is likewise evident that as the senses in changing their objects are necessitated to change them regularly and take them as they lie contiguous to each other the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects note in particular that in hume s view these perceptions do not belong to anything hume similar to the buddha compares the soul to a commonwealth which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance but by being composed of many different related and yet constantly changing elements the question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one s personal experience in short what matters for hume is not that identity exists but the fact that the relations of causation contiguity and resemblances obtain among the perceptions critics of hume state that in order for the various states and processes of the mind to seem unified there must be something which perceives their unity the existence of which would be no less mysterious than a personal identity hume solves this by considering substance as engendered by the togetherness of its properties no self theory the no self theory holds that the self cannot be reduced to a bundle because the concept of a self is incompatible with the idea of a bundle propositionally the idea of a bundle implies the notion of bodily or psychological relations that do not in fact exist james giles a principal exponent of this view argues that the no self or eliminativist theory and the bundle or reductionist theory agree about the non existence of a substantive self the reductionist theory according to giles mistakenly resurrects the idea of the self in terms of various accounts about psychological relations the no self theory on the other hand lets the self lie where it has fallen this is because the no self theory rejects all theories of the self even the bundle theory on giles reading hume is actually a no self theorist and it is a mistake to attribute to him a reductionist view like the bundle theory hume s assertion that personal identity is a fiction supports this reading according to giles the buddhist view of personal identity is also a no self theory rather than a reductionist theory because the buddha rejects attempts to reconstructions in terms of consciousness feelings or the body in notions of an eternal permanent unchanging self since our thoughts personalities and bodies are never the same from moment to moment as specifically explained in \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 according to this line of criticism the sense of self is an evolutionary artifact which saves time in the circumstances it evolved for but sense of self breaks down when considering some events such as memory loss dissociative identity disorder brain damage brainwashing and various thought experiments when presented with imperfections in the intuitive sense of self and the consequences to this concept which rely on the strict concept of self a tendency to mend the concept occurs possibly because of cognitive dissonance open individualism is a term coined by daniel kolak that refers to the view in the philosophy of self that there exists only one numerically identical subject who is everyone at all times in the past present and future 617 it is a theoretical solution to the question of personal identity being contrasted with empty individualism the view that personal identities correspond to a fixed pattern that instantaneously disappears with the passage of time and closed individualism the common view that personal identities are particular to subjects and yet survive over time xxii experimental philosophy since the 21st century philosophers have also been using the methods of psychological science to better understand philosophical intuitions this empirical approach to philosophy is known as experimental philosophy or xphi for short studies in xphi have found various psychological factors predict variance even in philosophers views about personal identity moral self theory findings from xphi suggest that moral intuitions may have a major influence on our intuitions about personal identity for example some experimental philosophers have found that when a person undergoes a dramatic change e g traumatic brain injury people are less likely to think that the person is the same after their dramatic change if the person became morally worse as opposed to morally better data like this support the moral self hypothesis that moral traits are essential to personal identity with some going as far as saying that when someone undergoes dramatic mental change their numerical identity whether they re the same person as they were before can seem to become disrupted numerical and qualitative while the direction of change e g moral improvement vs moral deterioration has been found to cause substantial shifts in peoples judgments about personal identity multiple studies find that none of these shifts constitute thinking that someone is numerically non identical to the person they were before the change such that the person before the change is one person and the person after the change is an entirely separate second person when people were asked how many people are described in cases of dramatic moral change the vast majority of answers were one rather than two or more this aligns with more recent evidence that these shifts in intuitions about personal identity are about qualitative identity i e how similar one is to a prior version of themselves rather than numerical identity i e whether there are two or more people described by cases in which a person undergoes a dramatic change see also philosophy of self concept in philosophy

which this transition takes place varies between societies as does the nature of the change it can be a simple legal convention or can be part of a ritual or spiritual event in the past and in some societies today such a change is often associated with the age of sexual maturity puberty especially menarche and spermarche in others it is associated with an age of religious responsibility particularly in western societies modern legal conventions stipulate points around the end of adolescence and the beginning of early adulthood most commonly 16 and 18 though ranging from 14 to 21 when adolescents are generally no longer considered minors and are granted the full rights and responsibilities of an adult some cultures and countries have multiple coming of age ceremonies for multiple

years later the quintos of the same year could still hold yearly meals to remember times past by the end of the 20th century the rural exodus the diffusion of city customs and the loss of prestige of military service changed the relevance of quintos parties in some places the party included the village girls of the same age thus becoming less directly related to military service in others the

and 3 years most commonly for one 3 month rainy season retreat vassa held annually from late july to early october during this period the boys experience the rigors of an orthodox buddhist monastic lifestyle a lifestyle that involves celibacy formal voluntary poverty absolute nonviolence and daily fasting between noon and the following day s sunrise depending on how long they stay the boys will learn various chants and recitations in the canonical language pali typically the buddha s more famous discourses suttas and verses gathas as well as buddhist ethics and higher monastic discipline

ordination as a fully ordained monk a bhikkhu or will more often return to lay life in southeast asian countries where most practitioners of theravada buddhism reside women will often refuse to marry a man who has not ordained temporarily as a samanera in this way at some point in his life men who have completed this samanera ordination and have returned to lay life are considered primed for adult married life and are described in the thai language and the khmer language by terms which roughly translate as cooked finished or cooled off in english as in meal preparation consumption thus one s monastic training is seen to have prepared one properly for familial social and civic duty and or one s passions and unruliness of the boy are seen to have cooled down enough for him to be of use to a woman as a proper man christianity in many western christian churches those deriving from rome after the east west schism a young person is eligible to receive confirmation which is considered a sacrament in catholicism and a rite in lutheranism anglicanism methodism irvingism and reformed christianity the catholic and methodist denominations teach that in confirmation the holy spirit strengthens a baptized individual for their faith journey this is usually done by a bishop or an abbot laying their hands upon the foreheads of the young person usually between the ages of 12 and 15 years and marking them with the seal of the holy spirit in some christian denominations the confirmand now an adult in the eyes of the church takes a saint s name as a confirmation name in christian denominations that practice believer s baptism baptism by voluntary decision as opposed to baptism in early infancy it is normatively carried out after the age of accountability has arrived as with many anabaptist denominations such as the mennonites some traditions withhold the rite of holy communion from those not yet at the age of accountability on the grounds that children do not understand what the sacrament means in the 20th century roman catholic children began to be admitted to communion some years before confirmation with an annual first communion service a practice that was extended to some paedobaptist protestant groups such as lutheranism and anglicanism but since the second vatican council the withholding of confirmation to a later age e g mid teens in the united states early teens in ireland and britain has in some areas been abandoned in favour of restoring the traditional order of the three sacraments of initiation in some denominations full membership in the church if not bestowed at birth often must wait until the age of accountability and frequently is granted only after a period of preparation known as catechesis the time of innocence before one has the ability to understand truly the laws of god and that god sees one as innocent is also seen as applying to individuals who suffer from a mental disability which prevents them from ever reaching a time when they are capable of understanding the laws of god these individuals are thus seen according to some christians as existing in a perpetual state of innocence catholicism in 1910 pope pius x issued the decree quam singulari which changed the age of eligibility for receiving both the sacrament of penance and the eucharist to a time when a child begins to reason that is about the seventh year more or less previously local standards had been at least 10 or 12 or even 14 years old historically the sacrament of confirmation has been administered to youth who have reached the age of discretion the catechism states that confirmation should be received at the appropriate time but in danger of death it can be administered to children together with the sacraments of baptism and the eucharist the sacrament of confirmation completes the sacraments of christian initiation for without confirmation and eucharist baptism is certainly valid and efficacious but christian initiation remains incomplete in eastern catholic churches infants receive confirmation and communion immediately after baptism in eastern christianity the baptising priest confirms infants directly after baptism the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the church of jesus christ of latter day saints sets the age of accountability and minimum age for baptism at 8 years of age all persons younger than 8 are considered innocent and not accountable for their sinning the church considers mentally challenged individuals whose mental age is under 8 to be in a perpetual state of innocence while other doctrines teach that no one is without sin both believe that those at a certain age are considered innocent confucianism according to the grand historian the duke of zhou wrote the rites of zhou about 3000 years ago which documented fundamental ceremonies in ancient china including the coming of age rite then confucius and his students wrote the book of rites which introduced and further explained important ceremonies in confucianism when a man turned 20 his parents would hold a guan li also named the capping ceremony when a girl turned 15 she would receive a ji li also known as the hairpin ceremony these rites were considered to represent a person being mature and prepared to get married and start a family therefore they were the beginning of all the moral rites during this rite of passage the young person receives his her style name hinduism in hinduism coming of age generally signifies that a boy or girl is mature enough to understand his responsibility towards family and society some castes in hinduism also have the sacred thread ceremony called upanayana for dvija twice born boys that mark their coming of age to do religious ceremonies a rite of passage males have to go through is bhrataman or chudakarma that marks adulthood if\u00e1 in the traditional if\u00e1 faith of the yoruba people of west africa and the many new world religions that it subsequently gave birth to men and women are often initiated to the service of one of the hundreds of subsidiary spirits that serve the orisha olodumare the group s conception of the almighty god the mystic links that are forged by way of these initiations which typically occur at puberty are the conduits that are used by adherents to attempt to achieve what can be seen as the equivalent of the buddhist enlightenment by way of a combination of personalized meditations reincarnations and spirit possessions islam children are not required to perform any obligatory religious obligations prior to reaching the age of puberty although they are encouraged to begin praying at the age of seven once a person begins puberty they are required to perform salat and other obligations of islam a girl is considered an adult when she begins menstruating while a boy is considered an adult at twelve to fifteen years old the evidence for this is the narration of ibn umar that he said allah s apostle called me to present myself in front of him on the eve of the battle of uhud while i was fourteen years of age at that time and he did not allow me to take part in that battle but he called me in front of him on the eve of the battle of the trench when i was fifteen years old and he allowed me to join the battle reported by bukhari and muslim when umar ibn abdul aziz heard this hadith he made this age the evidence to differentiate between a mature and an immature person in some islamic cultures circumcision khitan can be a ritual associated with coming of age for boys taking place in late

external links", "Nostalgia": "nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past typically for a period or place with happy personal associations the word nostalgia is a neoclassical compound derived from greek consisting of \u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00f3stos a homeric word meaning homecoming and \u1f04\u03bb\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u00e1lgos meaning pain the word was coined by a 17th century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by swiss mercenaries fighting away from home described as a medical condition a form of melancholy in the early modern period it became an important trope in romanticism nostalgia is associated with a longing for the past its personalities possibilities and events especially the good old days or a warm childhood there is a predisposition caused by cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection for people to view the past more positively and the future more negatively when applied to one s beliefs about a society or institution this is called declinism which has been described as a trick of the mind and as an emotional strategy something comforting to snuggle up to when the present day seems intolerably bleak the scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding one s personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia as induced during these studies emotion is a strong evoker of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala the emotional seat of the brain these recollections of one s past are usually important events people one cares about and places where one has spent time cultural phenomena such as music movies television shows and video games as well as natural phenomena such as weather and environment can also be strong triggers of nostalgia functions nostalgia s definition has changed greatly over time consistent with its greek word roots meaning homecoming and pain nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition characterized by expressing extreme homesickness the modern view is that nostalgia is an independent and even positive emotion that many people experience often nostalgia has been found to have important psychological functions such as to improve mood increase social connectedness enhance positive self regard and provide existential meaning nostalgia can lead individuals to perceive the past more favorably than the present a phenomenon known as the nostalgia effect which is classified as a cognitive bias many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function and overall seem to benefit those who experience them such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of nostalgia proneness nostalgia has also been associated with learning and memory consolidation improving mood although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings it results in increasing one s mood and heightening positive emotions which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections one way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one s happiness batcho 2013 found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages planning and implementing strategies and reframing the issue positively these studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them thus increasing support in challenging times increasing social connectedness nostalgia sometimes involves memories of people one was close to such as family members romantic lovers or friends and thus it can increase one s sense of social support and connections nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships according to zhou et al 2008 lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support loneliness however leads to nostalgia which actually increases perceptions of social support thus zhou and colleagues 2008 concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness preserving cultural heritage nostalgia serves as a motivator for the preservation of people s cultural heritage people endeavor to conserve buildings landscapes and other artifacts of historical significance out of nostalgia for past times they are often motivated by a desire to connect to their heritage from past generations this can manifest in living history events such as historical reenactments which bring together people with a shared nostalgia for historical periods of past times these events hands on improvisational natures often facilitate socialization enhancing positive self regard nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves vess et al 2012 found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences additionally in a second study conducted some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not the researchers looked again at self attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self centered attributes vess et al 2012 however found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection providing existential meaning nostalgia helps increase one s self esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress routledge 2011 and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one s sense of meaning in life the second study revealed that nostalgia increases one s perceived meaning in life which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness thirdly the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia thus increasing one s nostalgic reflections by triggering nostalgia though one s defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study the final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one s well being follow up studies also completed by routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning search for meaning less and can better buffer existential threat promoting psychological growth nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth oriented behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth oriented people baldwin landau 2014 found that nostalgia leads people to rate themselves higher on items like i am the kind of person who embraces unfamiliar people events and places nostalgia also increased interest in growth related behavior such as i would like to explore someplace that i have never been before in the first study these effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia induced positive affect the extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good in the second study nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia induced self esteem as a deception one recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia which in some forms can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical facts this study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid in south africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways restorative nostalgia a wish to return to that past and reflective nostalgia which is more critically aware as a comfort reliving past memories may provide comfort and contribute to mental health one notable recent medical study has looked at the physiological effects thinking about past good memories can have they found that thinking about the past fondly actually increased perceptions of physical warmth as a political tool in a 2014 study conducted by routledge he and a team observed that the more people reported having major disruptions and uncertainties in their lives the more they nostalgically longed for the past routledge suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past politicians can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that make nostalgia especially attractive and effective as a tool of political persuasion trigger factors cultural books a person can deliberately trigger feelings of nostalgia by listening to familiar music looking at old photos or visiting comforting environments of the past with this knowledge widely available many books have been published specifically to evoke the feeling of nostalgia music hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person a song heard once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date remembered and events that occurred then however if it is heard throughout life it may lose its association with any specific period or experience movies old movies can trigger nostalgia this is particularly true for generations who grew up as children during specific film eras such as the animation renaissance of the 1990s rewatching classic movies can be therapeutic in nature healing emotional wounds using happy childhood memories tv shows old television shows can trigger nostalgia people gravitate towards shows they watched as children as the memories from one s youth are often the most significant of their lives video games old video games can trigger nostalgia retrogaming has become a recreational activity among older generations who played them as children environmental geography specific locations can trigger nostalgia such places are often associated with an individual s past reminding them of their past childhood relationships or achievements they may include the homes where they grew up with their families the schools they attended with friends or the venues they went to for dating and marriage nature nature based factors such as weather and temperature can trigger nostalgia scientific studies have shown that cold weather makes people more nostalgic while nostalgia causes people to feel warmer in some societies elements of nature often trigger a nostalgia for past times when nature played a larger role in culture environmental philosopher glenn albrecht coined the term solastalgia in his 2003 book solastalgia a new concept in human health and identity the word is formed from the latin s\u014dl\u0101cium comfort and the greek root \u1f04\u03bb\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 pain suffering to describe a form of emotional or existential distress caused by environmental destruction nostalgia differs from solastalgia because nostalgia is typically generated by spatial separation from important places or persons one s home family friends or loved ones with which it is often possible in principle to reconnect with solastalgia in contrast the grief is typically caused by environmental destruction so the separation between subject and object is ontological rather than spatial it is permanent and unbridgeable and can be experienced while continuing to occupy the same irreversibly degraded place other aspects as a medical condition the term was coined in 1688 by johannes hofer 1669 1752 in his dissertation in basel the word nostalgia was compound of the ancient greek words nostos return home and algia longing hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays homesickness for the condition also known as mal du suisse swiss illness because of its frequent occurrence in swiss mercenaries who in the plains of switzerland were pining for their landscapes symptoms were also thought to include fainting high fever and death english homesickness is a loan translation of nostalgia sir joseph banks used the word in his journal during the first voyage of captain cook on 3 september 1770 he stated that the sailors were now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of nostalgia but his journal was not published in his lifetime cases resulting in death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by being discharged and sent home receiving a diagnosis was however generally regarded as an insult in the eighteenth century scientists were looking for a locus of nostalgia a nostalgic bone by the 1850s nostalgia was losing its status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a symptom or stage of a pathological process it was considered as a form of melancholia and a predisposing condition among suicides nostalgia was however still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the american civil war by the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical category had almost completely vanished nostalgia was still being recognized in both the first and second world wars especially by the american armed forces great lengths were taken to study and understand the condition to stem the tide of troops leaving the front in droves see the bbc documentary century of the self nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event or item from their past the resulting emotion can vary from happiness to sorrow the term feeling nostalgic is more commonly used to describe pleasurable emotions associated with or a longing to return to a particular period of time romanticism swiss nostalgia was linked to the singing of kuhreihen which were forbidden to swiss mercenaries because they led to nostalgia to the point of desertion illness or death the 1767 dictionnaire de musique by jean jacques rousseau claims that swiss mercenaries were threatened with severe punishment to prevent them from singing their swiss songs it became somewhat of a topos in romantic literature and figures in the poem der schweizer by achim von arnim 1805 and in clemens brentano s des knaben wunderhorn 1809 as well as in the opera le chalet by adolphe charles adam 1834 which was performed for queen victoria under the title the swiss cottage the romantic connection of nostalgia was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for switzerland and the development of early tourism in switzerland that took hold of the european cultural elite in the 19th century german romanticism coined an opposite to heimweh fernweh far sickness longing to be far away like wanderlust expressing the romantic desire to travel and explore in rhetoric and communication nostalgia has been frequently studied as a tool of rhetoric and persuasion communication scholar stephen depoe for example writes that in nostalgic messaging a speaker highlights a comparison between a more favorable idealized past and a less favorable present in order to stimulate nostalgia linking his her own policies to qualities of the idealized past in order to induce support 179 rhetorician william kurlinkus taxonomizes nostalgia on this foundation arguing that nostalgic rhetoric generally contains three parts a loss or threat in the present the chaotic change that nostalgia responds to though some theorists argue that the ideal must truly be lost other scholars including kurlinkus argue that the ideal may simply be threatened to trigger nostalgia a nostalgic crux a person group corporation et al that is blamed for the loss of the nostalgic ideal to perform such scapegoating the nostalgic crux is usually presented as a force of newness and change defeating this outsider is positioned as a source of recovering the good memory such cruxes have include groups from polluting corporations to immigrants hope finally kurlinkus argues that though nostalgia is often performed ironically it almost always has a true hope for recovering the good memory whether this means some kind of true restoration or a more symbolic recovery of an ethic such hope differentiates nostalgia from similar emotions like melancholia which contains all of nostalgia s longing for lost ideals without a desire to move out of that past kurlinkus coined the term nostalgic other to describe the ways in which some populations of people become trapped in other people s nostalgic stories of them idealized as natural while simultaneously denied sovereignty or the right to change in the present nostalgic others differ from other scholarly discourse in that their alterity is not primarily based in race or ethnicity kurlinkus wrote rather in concurrent identifications and divisions the nostalgic other is distinguished from the rhetor by time we live in the present they live in the past the creation of the nostalgic other allows mainstream populations to commodify the racial purity and stability of the past but refuses the community agency to change in the present by highlighting its negative traits as an advertising tool in media and advertising nostalgia evoking images sounds and references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume watch or buy advertised products modern technology facilitates nostalgia eliciting advertising through the subject style and design of an advertisement the feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these media require the participation of multiple senses are able to represent their ideas entirely and therefore become more reminiscent of life due to efficient advertising schemes consumers need not have experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel nostalgic for it this is due to a phenomenon referred to as vicarious nostalgia vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of wistful yearning for a moment that occurred prior to or outside of the span of one s memory but is relatable has sentimental value due to repeated mediated exposure to it the constant propagating of advertisements and other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible and changes the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently the way consumers use their purchasing power examples of nostalgia used to provoke public interest include nostalgia themed websites such as want nostalgia the nostalgia machine and doyouremember and revamps of old movies tv shows and books vintage rustic and old fashioned design styles can also be seen in nostalgia based ad campaigns that companies such as coca cola and levi strauss co use developed within the marketing discipline forestalgia 1 defined as an individual s yearning for an idealized future serves as a future focused counterpart to nostalgia like nostalgia where only the happy memories are retained forestalgia explains customers intentions to escape the present to a romanticized future where current concerns are no longer an issue marketing researchers found that when promoting hedonic and utilitarian products far past nostalgia and far future forestalgia advertisements were most effective in the promotion of utilitarian products in contrast hedonic products were better suited for advertisements framed in far past nostalgia or near future forestalgia nostalgia cycle it has been argued that there is a nostalgia cycle various durations of this cycle have been alleged including epicycles ie nostalgia for the last nostalgia cycle it has been said that if a twenty year nostalgia cycle applied then 1980s nostalgia would have ended circa 2010 in 2016 it was said that this had not happened and that a twenty year nostalgia cycle did not appear to apply it has been said that if you believe in nostalgia cycles then the popularity of mad men in the 2010s would require 1960s nostalgia to follow a forty year nostalgia cycle it has been argued that the nostalgia cycle has been disrupted and thus has ceased to exist or changed its duration to become longer or shorter and it has been argued that the internet is what disrupted it it has also been argued that the nostalgia cycle never existed and that belief in its

"Freedom": "freedom is the power or right to speak act and change as one wants without hindrance or restraint freedom is often associated with liberty and autonomy in the sense of giving oneself one s own laws in one definition something is free if it can change and is not constrained in its present state physicists and chemists use the word in this sense in its origin the english word freedom relates etymologically to the word friend philosophy and religion sometimes associate it with free will as an alternative to determinism or predestination in modern liberty nations freedom is considered a right especially freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom of the press types in political discourse political freedom is often associated with liberty and autonomy and a distinction is made between countries that are free of dictatorships in the area of civil rights a strong distinction is made between freedom and slavery and there is conflict between people who think all races religions genders and social classes should be equally free and people who think freedom is the exclusive right of certain groups frequently discussed are freedom of assembly freedom of association freedom of choice and freedom of speech liberty sometimes the terms freedom and liberty tend to be used interchangeably sometimes subtle distinctions are made between freedom and liberty john stuart mill for example differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily if not exclusively the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved as such the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others isaiah berlin made a distinction between positive freedom and negative freedom in his seminal 1958 lecture two concepts of liberty charles taylor elaborates that negative liberty means an ability to do what one wants without external obstacles and positive liberty is the ability to fulfill one s purposes another way to describe negative liberty is freedom from limiting forces such as freedom from fear freedom from want and freedom from discrimination but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty from anything wendy hui kyong chun explains these differences in terms of their relation to institutions liberty is linked to human subjectivity freedom is not the declaration of independence for example describes men as having liberty and the nation as being free free will the quality of being free from the control of fate or necessity may first have been attributed to human will but newtonian physics attributes freedom degrees of freedom free bodies to objects freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline liberty like discipline is linked to institutions and political parties whether liberal or libertarian freedom is not although freedom can work for or against institutions it is not bound to them it travels through unofficial networks to have liberty is to be liberated from something to be free is to be self determining autonomous freedom can or cannot exist within a state of liberty one can be liberated yet unfree or free yet enslaved orlando patterson has argued in freedom freedom in the making of western culture that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves from domination freedom from domination was considered by phillip pettit quentin skinner and john p mccormick as a defining aspect of freedom while operative control is the ability to direct ones actions on a day to day basis that freedom can depend on the whim of another also known as reserve control phillip petit and jamie susskind argue that both operative and reserve control are needed for democracy and freedom see also freedom 1985 statue by alfred tibor in columbus ohio freedom civilization 1944 book by bronislaw malinowski about freedom from

on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one s own life or the world at large as a verb merriam webster defines hope as to expect with confidence or to cherish a desire with anticipation among its opposites are dejection hopelessness and despair hope finds expression through many dimensions of human life including practical reasoning the religious virtue of hope legal doctrine and literature alongside cultural and mythological aspects in psychology american professor of psychology barbara fredrickson argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms opening us to new creative possibilities frederickson argues that with great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas as well as such positive emotions as happiness and joy courage and empowerment drawn from four different areas of one s self from a cognitive psychological social or physical perspective such positive thinking bears fruit when based on a realistic sense of optimism not on a naive false hope the psychologist charles r snyder linked hope to the existence of a goal combined with a determined plan for reaching that goal alfred adler had similarly argued for the centrality of goal seeking in human psychology as too had philosophical anthropologists like ernst bloch snyder also stressed the link between hope and mental willpower hardiness as well as the need for realistic perception of goals problem orientation arguing that the difference between hope and optimism was that the former can look like wishful thinking but the latter provides the energy to find practical pathways for an improved future d w winnicott saw a child s antisocial behavior as expressing as a cry for help an unconscious hope meaning an unspoken desire for a positive outcome for those who are in control in the wider society when containment within the immediate family had failed object relations theory similarly sees the analytic transference as motivated in part by an unconscious hope that past conflicts and traumas can be dealt with anew hope theory as a specialist in positive psychology snyder studied how hope and forgiveness can impact several aspects of life such as health work education and personal meaning he postulated that three main things make up hopeful thinking goals approaching life in a goal oriented way pathways finding different ways to achieve your goals agency believing that you can instigate change and achieve these goals in other words hope was defined as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals imagine multiple workable pathways toward those goals and persevere even when obstacles get in their way snyder proposed a hope scale which considered that a person s determination to achieve their goal is their measured hope snyder differentiates between adult measured hope and child measured hope the adult hope scale by snyder contains 12 questions 4 measuring pathways thinking 4 measuring agency thinking and 4 that are simply fillers each subject responds to each question using an 8 point scale fibel and hale measure hope by combining snyder s hope scale with their own generalized expectancy for success scale gess to empirically measure hope snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one s goals drawing on tacit knowledge of how to reach them similarly there is an outlook and a grasp of reality to hope distinguishing no hope lost hope false hope and real hope which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism contemporary philosopher richard rorty understands hope as more than goal setting rather as a metanarrative a story that serves as a promise or reason for expecting a better future rorty as postmodernist believes past meta narratives including the christian story utilitarianism and marxism have proved false hopes that theory cannot offer social hope and that liberal man must learn to live without a consensual theory of social hope rorty says a new document of promise is needed for social hope to exist again in healthcare major theories of the countless models that examine the importance of hope in an individual s life two major theories have gained a significant amount of recognition in the field of psychology one of these theories developed by charles r snyder argues that hope should be viewed as a cognitive skill that demonstrates an individual s ability to maintain drive in the pursuit of a particular goal this model reasons that an individual s ability to be hopeful depends on two types of thinking agency thinking and pathway thinking agency thinking refers to an individual s determination to achieve their goals despite possible obstacles while pathway thinking refers to the ways in which an individual believes they can achieve these personal goals snyder s theory uses hope as a mechanism that is most often seen in psychotherapy in these instances the therapist helps their client overcome barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals the therapist would then help the client set realistic and relevant personal goals i e i am going to find something i am passionate about and that makes me feel good about myself and would help them remain hopeful of their ability to achieve these goals and suggest the correct pathways to do so whereas snyder s theory focuses on hope as a mechanism to overcome an individual s lack of motivation to achieve goals the other major theory developed by kaye a herth deals more specifically with an individual s future goals as they relate to coping with illnesses herth views hope as a motivational and cognitive attribute that is theoretically necessary to initiate and sustain action toward goal attainment establishing realistic and attainable goals in this situation is more difficult as the individual most likely does not have direct control over the future of their health instead herth suggests that the goals should be concerned with how the individual is going to personally deal with the illness instead of drinking to ease the pain of my illness i am going to surround myself with friends and family while the nature of the goals in snyder s model differ with those in herth s model they both view hope as a way to maintain personal motivation which ultimately will result in a greater sense of optimism major empirical findings hope and more specifically particularized hope has been shown to be an important part of the recovery process from illness it has strong psychological benefits for patients helping them to cope more effectively with their disease for example hope motivates people to pursue healthy behaviors for recovery such as eating fruits and vegetables quitting smoking and engaging in regular physical activity this not only helps to enhance people s recovery from illnesses but also helps prevent illness from developing in the first place patients who maintain high levels of hope have an improved prognosis for life threatening illness and an enhanced quality of life belief and expectation which are key elements of hope block pain in patients suffering from chronic illness by releasing endorphins and mimicking the effects of morphine consequently through this process belief and expectation can set off a chain reaction in the body that can make recovery from chronic illness more likely this chain reaction is especially evident with studies demonstrating the placebo effect a situation when hope is the only variable aiding in these patients recovery overall studies have demonstrated that maintaining a sense of hope during a period of recovery from illness is beneficial a sense of hopelessness during the recovery period has in many instances resulted in adverse health conditions for the patient i e depression and anxiety following the recovery process additionally having a greater amount of hope before and during cognitive therapy has led to decreased ptsd related depression symptoms in war veterans hope has also been found to be associated with more positive perceptions of subjective health however reviews of research literature have noted that the connections between hope and symptom severity in other mental health disorders are less clear such as in cases of individuals with schizophrenia hope is a powerful protector against chronic or life threatening illnesses a person s hope even when facing an illness that will likely end their life can be helpful by finding joy or comfort it can be created and focused on achieving life goals such as meeting grandchildren or attending a child s wedding hope can be an opportunity for us to process and go through events that can be traumatic a setback in life an accident or our own final months of living can be times when hope is comfort and serves as a pathway from one stage to the next hope is a powerful emotion that drives us to keep working and moving forward it gives us the power to survive in a study conducted by harvard curt richter experimented with 12 wild rats and 12 domesticated rats the wild rats known for their great swimming abilities survived for only about two minutes when placed in a glass container of water with no way of escape in contrast the domesticated rats survived for days curt attributed this difference to hope the domesticated rats hoped to be saved from drowning but the wild rats had no such hope as they had never experienced rescue curt decided to run another experiment with 12 wild rats he placed them in water and when they were about to drown he took them out and held them briefly creating an experience of hope he then returned the rats to the water to observe how long they would tread water remarkably they survived just as long as the domesticated rats about 60 hours with hope the rats went from surviving for 2 minutes to treading water for 60 hours hope is a powerful emotion it drives us to move faster further and longer than we thought possible but for hope to thrive it must be anchored in something more powerful than ourselves the rats had hope that a saving hand would come and lift them out of the water applications the inclusion of hope in treatment programs has potential in both physical and mental health settings hope as a mechanism for improved treatment has been studied in the contexts of ptsd chronic physical illness and terminal illness among other disorders and ailments within mental health practice clinicians have suggested using hope interventions as a supplement to more traditional cognitive behavioral therapies in terms of support for physical illness research suggests that hope can encourage the release of endorphins and enkephalins which help to block pain impediments there are two main arguments based on judgment against those who are advocates of using hope to help treat severe illnesses the first of which is that if physicians have too much hope they may aggressively treat the patient the physician will hold on to a small shred of hope that the patient may get better thus this causes them to try methods that are costly and may have many side effects one physician noted that she regretted having hope for her patient it resulted in her patient suffering through three more years of pain that the patient would not have endured if the physician had realized recovery was unfeasible the second argument is the division between hope and wishing those that are hopeful are actively trying to investigate the best path of action while taking into consideration the obstacles research has shown though that many of those who have hope are wishfully thinking and passively going through the motions as if they are in denial about their actual circumstances being in denial and having too much hope may negatively impact both the patient and the physician benefits the impact that hope can have on a patient s recovery process is strongly supported through both empirical research and theoretical approaches however reviews of literature also maintain that more longitudinal and methodologically sound research is needed to establish which hope interventions are actually the most effective and in what setting i e chronic illness vs terminal illness in culture in the matter of globalization hope is focused on economic and social empowerment focusing on parts of asia hope has taken on a secular or materialistic form in relation to the pursuit of economic growth primary examples are the rise of the economies of china and india correlating with the notion of chindia a secondary relevant example is the increased use of contemporary architecture in rising economies such as the building of the shanghai world financial center burj khalifa and taipei 101 which has given rise to a prevailing hope within the countries of origin in chaotic environments hope is transcended without cultural boundaries syrian refugee children are supported by unesco s education project through creative education and psycho social assistance other inter cultural support for instilling hope involve food culture disengaging refugees from trauma through immersing them in their rich cultural past the right to hope hope has been widely recognized as a crucial and inherent aspect of human existence not only by philosophers from various backgrounds but also by national and international courts particularly in the past decade serving as an existential element within each individual hope manifests itself in various ways in both private and public spheres while past court considerations often focused on hopes arising from legal disputes and everyday life the current predominant topic of discussion centers around the hope of incarcerated individuals seeking release as in graham v florida riofrio s examination delves not only into specific expressions of the right to hope but also into the right to hope itself as a comprehensive concept in this exploration he draws connections between numerous legal doctrines addressing everyday hopes such as the doctrines of legitimate expectations and loss of a chance drawing insights from extensive case law explicitly referencing the right to hope international legal precedents philosophical teachings from eminent scholars and certain theological arguments riofrio concludes that the unenumerated right to hope encompasses four essential elements the right to have wishes aspirations plans and beliefs while avoiding actions that illegitimately discourage individuals such as demoralizing troops during wartime the right to some specific opportunities sometimes aligning with programmatic economic social and cultural rights escr but also incorporating the doctrine of legitimate expectations the right to the means of realizing hope prohibiting harm to the means that grounds hope such as the limbs of a dancer or the vision of a painter the right to some established chances wherein the doctrine of loss of a chance plays a significant role in literature hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tune without the words and never stops at all a classic reference to hope which has entered modern language is the concept that hope springs eternal taken from alexander pope s essay on man the phrase reading hope springs eternal in the human breast man never is but always to be blest another popular reference hope is the thing with feathers is from a poem by emily dickinson hope can be used as an artistic plot device and is often a motivating force for change in dynamic characters a commonly understood reference from western popular culture is the subtitle a new hope from the original first installment now considered episode iv in the star wars science fiction space opera the subtitle refers to one of the lead characters luke skywalker who is expected in the future to allow good to triumph over evil within the plot of the films the swallow has been a symbol of hope in aesop s fables and numerous other historic literature it symbolizes hope in part because it is among the first birds to appear at the end of winter and the start of spring other symbols of hope include the anchor and the dove nietzsche took a contrarian but coherent view of hope zeus did not wish man however much he might be tormented by the other evils to fling away his life but to go on letting himself be tormented again and again therefore he gives man hope in reality it is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man in mythology elpis hope appears in ancient greek mythology with the story of zeus and prometheus prometheus stole fire from the god zeus which infuriated the supreme god in turn zeus created a box that contained all manners of evil unbeknownst to the receiver of the box pandora opened the box after being warned not to and unleashed a multitude of harmful spirits that inflicted plagues diseases and illnesses on mankind spirits of greed envy hatred mistrust sorrow anger revenge lust and despair scattered far and wide looking for humans to torment inside the box however there was also an unreleased healing spirit named hope from ancient times people have recognized that a spirit of hope had the power to heal afflictions and helps them bear times of great suffering illnesses disasters loss and pain caused by the malevolent spirits and events in hesiod s works and days the personification of hope is named elpis norse mythology however considered hope v\u00f6n to be the slobber dripping from the mouth of fenris wolf their concept of courage rated most highly a cheerful bravery in the absence of hope in religion hope is a key concept in most major world religions often signifying the hoper believes an individual or a collective group will reach a concept of heaven depending on the religion hope can be seen as a prerequisite for and or byproduct of spiritual attainment judaism the jewish encyclopedia notes ti\u1e33wah

of the three theological virtues of the christian religion alongside faith and love hope in the holy bible means a strong and confident expectation of future reward see titus 1 2 in modern terms hope is akin to trust and a confident expectation paul the apostle argued that christ was a source of hope for christians for in this hope we have been saved see romans 8 24 according to the holman bible

rebellion a rebel group is a consciously coordinated group that seeks to gain political control over an entire state or a portion of a state a rebellion is often caused by political religious or social grievances that originate from a perceived inequality or marginalization rebellion comes from latin re and bellum and in lockian philosophy refers to the responsibility of the people to overthrow unjust government classification uprisings which revolt resisting and taking direct action against an authority law or policy as well as organize are rebellions an insurrection is an uprising to change the government if a government does not recognize rebels as belligerents then they are insurgents and the revolt is an insurgency in a larger conflict the rebels may be recognized as belligerents without their government being recognized by the established government in which case the conflict becomes a civil war civil resistance movements have often aimed at and brought about the fall of a government or head of state and in these cases they could be considered a form of rebellion in many of these cases the opposition movement saw itself not only as nonviolent but also as upholding their country s constitutional system against a government that was unlawful for example if it had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election thus rebel does not always capture the element in some of these movements of acting to defend the rule of law and constitutionalism in contrast an attempt for an overthrow of a government by and installation of a limited group of people is a putsch and by an elite a coup d \u00e9tat if the existing system of society like a government or its form is changed it is most often called a revolution causes macro approach the following theories broadly build on the marxist interpretation of rebellion rebellion is studied in theda skocpol s words by analyzing objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations rather than the interests outlooks or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions marxist view karl marx s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of political violence not as anomic episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class based relations of power the central tenet of marxist philosophy as expressed in das kapital is the analysis of society s mode of production societal organization of technology and labor and the relationships between people and their material conditions marx writes about the hidden structure of society that must be elucidated through an examination of the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers the conflict that arises from producers being dispossessed of the means of production and therefore subject to the possessors who may appropriate their products is at the origin of the revolution the inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization such as capitalism emerging within feudalism or more contemporarily socialism arising within capitalism the dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary for example the development of the bourgeoisie class went from an oppressed merchant class to urban independence eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole social movements are thus determined by an exogenous set of circumstances the proletariat must also according to marx go through the same process of self determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie in marx s theory revolutions are the locomotives of history because revolution ultimately leads to the overthrow of a parasitic ruling class and its antiquated mode of production later rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy one that is better suited to the new ruling class thus enabling societal progress the cycle of revolution thus replaces one mode of production with another through the constant class friction ted gurr roots of political violence in his book why men rebel ted gurr looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework he defines political violence as all collective attacks within a political community against the political regime its actors or its policies the concept represents a set of events a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order more precisely individuals become angry when they feel what gurr labels as relative deprivation meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to he labels it formally as the perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation decremental deprivation one s capacities decrease when expectations remain high one example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of the value of higher education aspirational deprivation one s capacities stay the same when expectations rise an example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better prepared colleagues bypass her progressive deprivation expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up a good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatization of the assembly line anger is thus comparative one of his key insights is that the potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity this means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on the particular internalization of their situation as such gurr differentiates between three types of political violence turmoil when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation conspiracy when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation internal war which includes revolution in this case the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society unlike the conspiracy charles tilly centrality of collective action in from mobilization to revolution charles tilly argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society collective violence tilly writes is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires he proposes two models to analyze political violence the polity model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power thus both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included tilly labels those two groups members and challengers the mobilization model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power tilly further divides the model into two sub categories one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group and the other that is concerned with the external relations of the entity with other organizations and or the government according to tilly the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization thus to answer gurr anger alone does not automatically create political violence political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite it is far from irrational and spontaneous revolutions are included in this theory although they remain for tilly particularly extreme since the challenger s aim for nothing less than full control over power the revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero sum game this is what tilly calls multiple sovereignty the success of a revolutionary movement hinges on the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over government chalmers johnson and societal values for chalmers johnson rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in the analysis of viable functioning societies in a quasi biological manner johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric a healthy society meaning a value coordinated social system does not experience political violence johnson s equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society to adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values the legitimacy of political order he posits relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change rigidity is in other words inadmissible johnson writes to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change more exactly it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure the aim of a revolution is to re align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming de synchronized the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position a simplified example would be the french revolution when the parisian bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the king as synchronized with its own orientations more than the king itself what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class johnson emphasizes the necessity of investigating a system s value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way theda skocpol and the autonomy of the state skocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution to be contrasted with a political revolution while the latter aims to change the polity the former is rapid basic transformations of a society s state and class structures and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class based revolts from below social revolutions are a grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society as a corollary this means that some revolutions may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society her analysis is limited to studying the french russian and chinese revolutions skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action the collapse of the old regime state this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions she highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs more precisely she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors the landed upper class and the imperial state both could be considered as partners in exploitation but in reality competed for resources the state monarchs seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence the upper class works in a logic of profit maximization meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources all three revolutions occurred skocpol argues because states failed to be able to mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations the apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the bourbon romanov and manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures skocpol further concludes the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machinery that had theretofore provided the solely unified bulwark of social and political order peasant uprisings more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall these uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures per se but at the upper class itself so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well skocpol quotes barrington moore who famously wrote peasants provided the dynamite to bring down the old building peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions the level of autonomy from both an economic and political point of view peasant communities enjoy and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics in other words peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel if the coercive structures of the state and or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity then there is no space to foment dissent societal transformation this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords the paradox of the three revolutions skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts the exact parameters depend again on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors in russia the new state found most support in the industrial base rooting itself in cities in china most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas in france the peasantry was not organized enough and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything partially explaining its artificiality here is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries according to skocpol microfoundational evidence on causes the following theories are all based on mancur olson s work in the logic of collective action a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent problem with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits in this case the benefits of rebellion are seen as a public good meaning one that is non excludable and non rivalrous the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for collective action in fact he argues the free rider possibility a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price will deter rational individuals from collective action that is unless there is a clear benefit a rebellion will not happen en masse thus olson shows that selective incentives only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort can solve the free rider problem the rational peasant samuel l popkin builds on olson s argument in the rational peasant the political economy of rural society in vietnam his theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join or not a rebellion uniquely on a cost benefit analysis this formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self interest a peasant according to popkin will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him according to popkin peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability social norms he writes are malleable renegotiated and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition due to the peculiar nature of the patron client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make popkin argues that peasants rely on their private family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis \u00e0 vis the village they will attempt to improve their long run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance popkin stresses this investor logic that one may not expect in agrarian societies usually seen as pre capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital yet the selfish determinants of collective action are according to popkin a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life the goal of a laborer for example will be to move to a tenant position then smallholder then landlord where there is less variance and more income voluntarism is thus non existent in such communities popkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation contribution to the expenditure of resources collective action has a cost in terms of contribution and especially if it fails an important consideration with regards to rebellion rewards the direct more income and indirect less oppressive central state rewards for collective action marginal impact of the peasant s contribution to the success of collective action leadership viability and trust to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used without any moral commitment to the community this situation will engineer free riders popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem opportunity cost of rebellion political scientist christopher blattman and world bank economist laura ralston identify rebellious activity as an occupational choice they draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities in both cases only a selected few reap important benefits while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs the choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel thus the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision blattman and ralston however recognize that a poor person s best strategy might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time individuals they argue can often have a varied portofolio of activities suggesting that they all operate on a rational profit maximizing logic the authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion selective incentives based on group membership the decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group more than material incentives for the individual rebellions offer their members club goods public goods that are reserved only for the members inside that group economist eli berman and political scientist david d laitin s study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership berman and laitin discuss suicide operations meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual they find that in such a framework the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection furthermore the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized berman and laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety basic infrastructure access to utilities or schooling suicide operations can be explained as a costly signal of commitment to the community they further note groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment sacrifices may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility thus rebellious groups can organize themselves to ask of members proof of commitment to the cause club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection greed vs grievance model world bank economists paul collier and anke hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives greed rebellion motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint grievance rebellion motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an ethnic majority political repression or economic inequality the two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality vollier and hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts while the model based on greed performs well the authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model individuals are fundamentally risk averse however they allow that conflicts create grievances which in turn can become risk factors contrary to established beliefs they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer since individuals will be automatically more cautious at the opposite of the grievance model predictions finally the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the diaspora of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection the moral economy of the peasant spearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist james c scott in his book the moral economy of the peasant the moral economy school considers moral variables such as social norms moral values interpretation of justice and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel this perspective still adheres to olson s framework but it considers different variables to enter the cost benefit analysis the individual is still believed to be rational albeit not on material but moral grounds early conceptualization e p thompson and bread riots in england british historian e p thompson is often cited as being the first to use the term moral economy he said in his 1991 publication that the term had been in use since the 18th century in his 1971 past present journal article moral economy of the english crowd in the eighteenth century he discussed english bread riots and other localized form of rebellion by english peasants throughout the 18th century he said that these events have been routinely dismissed as riotous with the connotation of being disorganized spontaneous undirected and undisciplined he wrote that on the contrary such riots involved a coordinated peasant action from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops a scholar such as popkin has argued that peasants were trying to gain material benefits such as more food thompson sees a legitimization factor meaning a belief that the peasants were defending traditional rights and customs thompson goes on to write that the riots were legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people in 1991 twenty years after his original publication thompson said that his object of analysis was the mentalit\u00e9 or as he would prefer the political culture the expectations traditions and indeed superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market the opposition between a traditional paternalist and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal capitalist and market derived ethics is central to explain rebellion james c scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument in his 1976 book the moral economy of the peasant rebellion and subsistence in southeast asia james c scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in southeast asia scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist therefore any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium he labels this phenomenon the subsistence ethic a landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant s subsistence over his constant benefit according to scott the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief a moral outrage other non material incentives blattman and ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives such as anger outrage and injustice grievance in the roots of rebellions these variables they argue are far from being irrational as they are sometimes presented they identify three main types of grievance arguments intrinsic incentives holds that injustice or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution more than material rewards individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged the ultimatum game is an excellent illustration player one receives 10 and must split it with another player who does not get the chance to determine how much he receives but only if the deal is made or not if he refuses everyone loses their money rationally player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term 1 more remains 1 more however player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars meaning that they are willing to pay a 2 for justice to be respected this game according to blattman and ralston represents the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice loss aversion holds that people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point and that they are loss adverse individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains there is a substantial subjective part to this however as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor for example to fix this gap individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss frustration aggression this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat there are limits to this theory violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of preferences yet this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum recruitment stathis n kalyvas a political science professor at yale university argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio economic factors from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges rebellion or any sort of political violence are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair at the intersection between the political and the private the collective and the individual kalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms the idea that political violence and more specifically rebellion is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state this is inspired by thomas hobbes views the approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot using violence to break down the power structures of society the idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity violence is thus not a man to man affair as much as a state to state struggle if not an idea vs idea conflict kalyvas key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts any individual actor kalyvas posits enters into a calculated alliance with the collective rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological religious ethnic or class cleavage the agency is located both within the collective and in the individual in the universal and the local kalyvas writes alliance entails a transaction between supralocal and local actors whereby the former supply the later with external muscle thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control resources and information even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage while the collective actors will aim to gain power violence is a mean as opposed to a goal according to kalyvas the greater takeaway from this central local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology but a conversation between the two rebellions are concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage any pre conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre conceived idea kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse decisions or ideologies from the center of collective action instead the focus must be on local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics furthermore rebellion is not a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence rather it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause rebel governance rebel governance is the development of institutions rules and norms by rebel groups with an intent to regulate civilians social economic and political life usually in areas under the territorial control of the rebel groups rebel governance may include systems of taxation regulations on social conduct judicial systems and public goods provision peace agreements one third of rebel leaders who sign peace agreements with the state experience exile imprisonment or unnatural death while two thirds go into regular politics or pursue further rebellion see also list of revolutions and rebellions list of active rebel groups footnotes references sources external

the birth of the person who is being honored while there is historical precedent for birthday parties for the rich and powerful throughout history the tradition extended to middle class americans around the nineteenth century and took on more modern norms and traditions in the twentieth century birthday parties are now a feature of many cultures in western cultures birthday parties include a number of common rituals the guests may be asked to bring a gift for the honored person party locations are often decorated with colorful decorations such as balloons and streamers a birthday cake is

wear colorful cone shaped party hats birthday parties are often larger and more extravagant if they celebrate someone who has reached what is regarded in the culture as a milestone age such as the transition from childhood to adulthood examples of traditional coming of age celebrations include the north american sweet sixteen party and the latin american quincea\u00f1era since medieval times

in whose honor it is being held birthday surprise parties are the most common kind of surprise party at most such parties the guests will arrive an hour or so before the honoree arrives often a friend in on the surprise will lead the honoree to the location of the party without letting on anything the guests might even conceal themselves from view and then when the honoree enters the room they leap from hiding and all shout surprise for some surprise birthday parties it is considered to be a good tactic to shock the honoree streamers silly string and balloons may be used for this purpose

buckingham palace the white house or government houses of the british empire and commonwealth the hosts and any guests of honor form a receiving line in order of precedence near the entrance each guest is announced to the host who greets each one in turn as he or she arrives each guest properly speaks little more than his name if necessary and a conventional greeting or congratulation to each person in the receiving line in this way the line of guests progresses steadily without unnecessary delay after formally receiving each guest in this fashion the hosts may mingle with the guests somewhat less formal receptions are common in academic settings sometimes to honor a guest lecturer or to celebrate a special occasion such as retirement of a respected member of staff receptions are

attitudes toward drinking vary around the world nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of brewing beer fermenting wine and distilling spirits among other practices alcohol has been present in numerous societies over the centuries with the production and consumption of alcoholic beverages date back to ancient civilisations drinking is documented in the hebrew and christian bibles in the qur an in greek and roman literature as old as homer in confucius analects and in various forms of artistic expression throughout history drinking habits vary significantly across the globe with many countries have developed their own regional cultures based on unique traditions around the fermentation and consumption of alcohol as a social lubricant which may also be known as a beer culture wine culture etc after a particularly prominent type of drink history alcohol has played a significant role in human history the production and consumption of alcoholic beverages date back to ancient civilisations the earliest evidence of alcohol comes from a neolithic village dating to around 7000bc in the yellow valley societies and cultures around the world have made use of intoxicating substances with alcohol as the most popular featured in temple rituals for 2 000 years in mesopotamia the world s oldest known recipe for beer making can be traced back to 3200 bc with related pictographs dated to 4000 bc similarly wine has ancient roots with evidence of production in jemdet nasr in 3000 bc georgia from around 6000 bc and iran from 5000 bc these practices were not just culinary but often held religious and medicinal significance since the greek and roman eras bacchanalia rituals involved consuming heavy levels of alcohol to reach an ecstatic

television broadcasts sports bars and arenas contributing to the drinking culture surrounding the sport a 2007 study at the university of texas at austin monitored the drinking habits of 541 students over two football seasons it revealed that high profile game days ranked among the heaviest drinking occasions similar to new year s eve male students increased their consumption for all games while socially active female students drank heavily during away games lighter drinkers also showed a higher likelihood of risky behaviors during away games as their intoxication increased this research highlights specific drinking patterns linked to collegiate sports events while social drinking often involves moderation it does not strictly emphasize safety or specific quantities unlike terms such as responsible drinking or light moderate and heavy social settings can involve peer pressure to drink more than intended which can be a risk factor for excessive alcohol consumption regularly socializing over drinks can lead to a higher tolerance for alcohol and potentially alcohol dependence especially in groups where drinking is a central activity according to a 2022 study recreational

1993 copies of the rules soon appeared in many pubs throughout the united kingdom kate fox a social anthropologist came up with a similar idea in her book watching the english but concluded their rationale was the need to minimize the possibility of violence between drinking companions when it is socially acceptable to drink differs around the world for example drinking at early times of the day is frowned upon in some countries including britain iceland and the czech republic whose drinkers limit themselves to the evening some don t start until past midnight and stay out especially late

bektashi order and alevi jem ceremonies in the japanese religion shinto by the new religious movement thelema in vajrayana buddhism in vodou faith of haiti and in the jewish kiddush by country drinking habits vary significantly across the globe in many european countries wine and beer are integral to the dining experience reflecting a culture of moderate meal centric drinking conversely in countries like russia higher rates of hard liquor consumption are observed which has been linked to social and health issues furthermore some islamic countries have religious prohibitions against alcohol leading to markedly different drinking practices some cultures may have a higher tolerance for alcohol consumption while others may stigmatize it cultural practices traditions and expectations regarding masculinity can influence drinking patterns among people some studies have noted traditional cultural differences between northern and southern europe a difference in perception may also account to some extent for historically noted cultural differences northern europeans drink beer which in the past was often of a low alcohol content 2 5 compared to today s 5 in pre industrial

while moderate alcohol consumption is often cited for potential health benefits such as reduced risk of heart disease excessive drinking is linked to numerous health risks including liver disease cardiovascular problems and addiction the world health organization categorizes alcohol as a group 1 carcinogen indicating its causal link to cancer it is crucial to balance these perspectives to understand the full impact of alcohol on health several studies over recent decades have linked moderate alcohol consumption with a reduced risk of heart disease however experts caution that this research may not fully account for the influence of other healthy lifestyle factors or the health history of participants who abstain from drinking policy makers have often expressed concern over drinking culture due to negative health effects of excess alcohol consumption policy makers often focus especially on patterns of problem drinking these patterns are often expressed in geographical terms such as in national drinking habits understanding drinking in young people should be done through a developmental framework this would be referred to as a whole system approach to underage drinking as it takes into account a particular adolescent s unique risk and protective factors from genetics and personality characteristics to social and environmental factors as early as the eighth century saint boniface was writing to cuthbert archbishop of canterbury to report how in your diocese the vice of drunkenness is too frequent this is an evil peculiar to pagans and to our race neither the franks nor the gauls nor the lombards nor the romans nor the greeks commit it it is probable however that the vice of drunkenness was present in all european nations the 16th century frenchman rabelais wrote comedic and absurd satires illustrating his countrymen s drinking habits and saint augustin used the example of a drunkard in rome to illustrate certain spiritual principles these varying capacities do not however avoid all health risks inherent in heavy alcohol consumption alcohol abuse is associated with a variety of negative health and safety outcomes this is true no matter

most dangerous of all operating a vehicle chronic heavy drinkers display functional tolerance when they show few obvious signs of intoxication even at high blood alcohol concentrations which in others

mental diversion from unpleasant aspects of daily life typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment escapism also may be used to occupy one s self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness perceptions entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life especially into the digital world many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence e g eating sleeping exercise sexual activity can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context and as a result the word escapism often carries a negative connotation suggesting that escapists are unhappy with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action indeed the oxford english dictionary defined escapism as the tendency to seek or the practice of seeking distraction from what normally has to be endured however many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative c s lewis was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers similarly j r r tolkien argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary imaginative world but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them if they were not to be mere escapism terry pratchett considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature apart from literature music and video games have been seen and valued as artistic media of escape too psychological escapes freud considers a quota of escapist fantasy a necessary element in the life of humans t hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality we simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions theodor fontane once said his followers saw rest and wish fulfilment in small measures as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted moods especially anger and sadness however if permanent residence is taken up in some such psychic retreats the results will often be negative and even pathological drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing escapist societies some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of bettering the condition of the people what juvenal called bread and the games social philosopher ernst bloch wrote that utopias and images of fulfillment however regressive they might be also included an impetus for a radical social change according to bloch social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently something that is mere daydreaming or escapism from the viewpoint of a technological rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order as it can be seen as an immature but honest substitute for revolution escapist societies appear often in literature the time machine depicts the eloi a lackadaisical insouciant race of the future and the horror of their happy lifestyle beliefs the novel subtly criticizes capitalism or at least classism as a means of escape escapist societies are common in dystopian novels for example in the fahrenheit 451 society television and seashell radios are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war in science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one examples include the virtual world of oz in the 2009 japanese animated science fiction film summer wars and the game society in the 2009 american science fiction film gamer a play on the real life mmo game second life other escapist societies in literature include the reality bug by d j mchale where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they jump into their perfect realities the aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect to regain control over their dying planet escape scale the norwegian psychologist frode stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements he discusses the paradox that the flow state csikszentmihalyi resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse sexual masochism and suicide ideation baumeister accordingly he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity escapism in the form of self suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts self perceptions and emotions whereas self expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self stenseng has developed the escape scale to measure self suppression and self expansion in people s favorite activities such as sports arts and gaming empirical investigations of the model have shown that the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism situational levels of well being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time during the great depression alan brinkley author of culture and politics in the great depression presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by the stock market crash in 1929 magazines radio and movies all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn life magazine which became hugely popular during the 1930s was said to have pictures that give no indication that there was such a thing as depression most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes of almost anything but poverty and unemployment famous director preston sturges aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called sullivan s travels about a director of lightweight comedies wanting to make a serious message picture titled o brother where art thou the film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic mickey mouse cartoon that ultimately lifts their spirits sturges aims to point out how foolish and vain and self indulgent it would be to make a film about suffering therefore movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them these films consciously deliberately set out to divert people from their problems but it also diverted

of diem is the accusative of dies day a more literal translation of carpe diem would thus be pluck the day as it is ripe that is enjoy the moment it has been argued by various authors that this

the context of the poem is more accurately translated as plucking the day evoking the plucking and gathering of ripening fruits or flowers enjoying a moment that is rooted in the sensory experience of nature history sources text from odes 1 11 in ancient literature perhaps the first written expression of the concept is the advice given by siduri to gilgamesh in mesopotamian mythology telling him to forgo his mourning and embrace life although some scholars see it as simply urging gilgamesh to abandon his mourning reversing the liminal rituals of mourning and returning to the normal and normative behaviors of mesopotamian society meaning in horace the phrase is part of the longer carpe diem quam minimum credula postero which is often translated as seize the day put very little trust in

which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature and that all things including mental states and consciousness are results of material interactions of material things according to philosophical materialism mind and consciousness are caused by physical processes such as the neurochemistry of the human brain and nervous system without which they cannot exist materialism directly contrasts with monistic idealism according to which consciousness is the fundamental substance of nature materialism is closely related to physicalism the view that all that exists is ultimately physical philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the theories of the physical sciences to incorporate forms of physicality in addition to ordinary matter e g spacetime physical energies and forces and exotic matter thus some prefer the term physicalism to materialism while others use the terms as if they were synonymous discoveries of neural correlates between consciousness and the brain are taken as empirical support for materialism but some philosophers of mind find that association fallacious or consider it compatible with non materialist ideas alternative philosophies opposed or alternative to materialism or physicalism include idealism pluralism dualism panpsychism and other forms of monism epicureanism is a philosophy of materialism from classical antiquity that was a major forerunner of modern science though ostensibly a deist epicurus affirmed the literal existence of the greek gods in either some type of celestial heaven cognate from which they ruled the universe if not on a literal mount olympus and his philosophy promulgated atomism while platonism taught roughly the opposite despite plato s teaching of zeus as god overview materialism belongs to the class of monist ontology and is thus different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism for singular explanations of the phenomenal reality materialism is in contrast to idealism neutral monism and spiritualism it can also contrast with phenomenalism vitalism and dual aspect monism its materiality can in some ways be linked to the concept of determinism as espoused by enlightenment thinkers despite the large number of philosophical schools and their nuances all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories defined in contrast to each other idealism and materialism a the basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality the primary difference between them is how they answer two fundamental questions what reality consists of and how it originated to idealists spirit or mind or the objects of mind ideas are primary and matter secondary to materialists matter is primary and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary the product of matter acting upon matter the materialist view is perhaps best understood in its opposition to the doctrines of immaterial substance applied to the mind historically by ren\u00e9 descartes by itself materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized in practice it is frequently assimilated to one variety of physicalism or another modern philosophical materialists extend the definition of other scientifically observable entities such as energy forces and the spacetime continuum some philosophers such as mary midgley suggest that the concept of matter is elusive and poorly defined during the 19th century karl marx and friedrich engels extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a materialist conception of history centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity practice including labor and the institutions created reproduced or destroyed by that activity they also developed dialectical materialism by taking hegelian dialectics stripping them of their idealist aspects and fusing them with materialism see modern philosophy non reductive materialism materialism is often associated with reductionism according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description if they are genuine must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description typically at a more reduced level non reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects properties or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents jerry fodor held this view according to which empirical laws and explanations in special sciences like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics history early history before common era materialism developed possibly independently in several geographically separated regions of eurasia during what karl jaspers termed the axial age c 800 200 bc in ancient indian philosophy materialism developed around 600 bc with the works of ajita kesakambali payasi kanada and the proponents of the c\u0101rv\u0101ka school of philosophy kanada became one of the early proponents of atomism the nyaya vaisesika school c 600 100 bc developed one of the earliest forms of atomism although their proofs of god and their positing that consciousness was not material precludes labelling them as materialists buddhist atomism and the jaina school continued the atomic tradition ancient greek atomists like leucippus democritus and epicurus prefigure later materialists the latin poem de rerum natura by lucretius 99 c 55 bc reflects the mechanistic philosophy of democritus and epicurus according to this view all that exists is matter and void and all phenomena result from different motions and conglomerations of base material particles called atoms literally indivisibles de rerum natura provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion evaporation wind and sound famous principles like nothing can touch body but body first appeared in lucretius s work democritus and epicurus did not espouse a monist ontology instead espousing the ontological separation of matter and space i e that space is another kind of being early common era wang chong 27 c 100 ad was a chinese thinker of the early common era said to be a materialist later indian materialist jayaraashi bhatta 6th century in his work tattvopaplavasimha the upsetting of all principles refuted the ny\u0101ya s\u016btra epistemology the materialistic c\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400 when madhavacharya compiled sarva dar\u015bana samgraha a digest of all philosophies in the 14th century he had no c\u0101rv\u0101ka or lok\u0101yata text to quote from or refer to in early 12th century al andalus arabian philosopher ibn tufail a k a abubacer discussed materialism in his philosophical novel hayy ibn yaqdhan philosophus autodidactus while vaguely foreshadowing historical materialism modern philosophy in france pierre gassendi 1592 1665 represented the materialist tradition in opposition to the attempts of ren\u00e9 descartes 1596 1650 to provide the natural sciences with dualist foundations there followed the materialist and atheist abb\u00e9 jean meslier 1664 1729 along with the french materialists julien offray de la mettrie 1709 1751 denis diderot 1713 1784 \u00e9tienne bonnot de condillac 1714 1780 claude adrien helv\u00e9tius 1715 1771 german french baron d holbach 1723 1789 and other french enlightenment thinkers in england materialism was developed in the philosophies of francis bacon 1561 1626 thomas hobbes 1588 1679 and john locke 1632 1704 scottish enlightenment philosopher david hume 1711 1776 became one of the most important materialist philosophers in the 18th century john walking stewart 1747 1822 believed matter has a moral dimension which had a major impact on the philosophical poetry of william wordsworth 1770 1850 in late modern philosophy german atheist anthropologist ludwig feuerbach signaled a new turn in materialism in his 1841 book the essence of christianity which presented a humanist account of religion as the outward projection of man s inward nature feuerbach introduced anthropological materialism a version of materialism that views materialist anthropology as the universal science feuerbach s variety of materialism heavily influenced karl marx who in the late 19th century elaborated the concept of historical materialism the basis for what marx and friedrich engels outlined as scientific socialism the materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and next to production the exchange of things produced is the basis of all social structure that in every society that has appeared in history the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced how it is produced and how the products are exchanged from this point of view the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought not in men s brains not in men s better insights into eternal truth and justice but in changes in the modes of production and exchange they are to be sought not in the philosophy but in the economics of each particular epoch through his dialectics of nature 1883 engels later developed a materialist dialectic philosophy of nature a worldview that georgi plekhanov the father of russian marxism called dialectical materialism in early 20th century russian philosophy vladimir lenin further developed dialectical materialism in his 1909 book materialism and empirio criticism which connects his opponents political conceptions to their anti materialist philosophies a more naturalist oriented materialist school of thought that developed in the mid 19th century was german materialism which included ludwig b\u00fcchner 1824 1899 the dutch born jacob moleschott 1822 1893 and carl vogt 1817 1895 even though they had different views on core issues such as the evolution and the origins of life contemporary history analytic philosophy contemporary analytic philosophers e g daniel dennett willard van orman quine donald davidson and jerry fodor operate within a broadly physicalist or scientific materialist framework producing rival accounts of how best to accommodate the mind including functionalism anomalous monism and identity theory scientific materialism is often synonymous with and has typically been described as a reductive materialism in the early 21st century paul and patricia churchland advocated a radically contrasting position at least in regard to certain hypotheses eliminative materialism eliminative materialism holds that some mental phenomena simply do not exist at all and that talk of such phenomena reflects a spurious folk psychology and introspection illusion a materialist of this variety might believe that a concept like belief has no basis in fact e g the way folk science speaks of demon caused illnesses with reductive materialism at one end of a continuum our theories will reduce to facts and eliminative materialism at the other certain theories will need to be eliminated in light of new facts revisionary materialism is somewhere in the middle continental philosophy contemporary continental philosopher gilles deleuze has attempted to rework and strengthen classical materialist ideas contemporary theorists such as manuel delanda working with this reinvigorated materialism have come to be classified as new materialists new materialism has become its own subfield with courses on it at major universities as well as numerous conferences edited collections and monographs devoted to it jane bennett s 2010 book vibrant matter has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by poststructuralist theories of language and discourse scholars such as mel y chen and zakiyyah iman jackson have critiqued this body of new materialist literature for neglecting to consider the materiality of race and gender in particular m\u00e9tis scholar zoe todd as well as mohawk bear clan six nations and anishinaabe scholar vanessa watts query the colonial orientation of the race for a new materialism watts in particular describes the tendency to regard matter as a subject of feminist or philosophical care as a tendency too invested in the reanimation of a eurocentric tradition of inquiry at the expense of an indigenous ethic of responsibility other scholars such as helene vosters echo their concerns and have questioned whether there is anything particularly new about new materialism as indigenous and other animist ontologies have attested to what might be called the vibrancy of matter for centuries others such as thomas nail have critiqued vitalist versions of new materialism for depoliticizing flat ontology and being ahistorical quentin meillassoux proposed speculative materialism a post kantian return to david hume also based on materialist ideas defining matter the nature and definition of matter like other key concepts in science and philosophy have occasioned much debate is there a single kind of matter hyle that everything is made of or are there multiple kinds is matter a continuous substance capable of expressing multiple forms hylomorphism or a number of discrete unchanging constituents atomism does matter have intrinsic properties substance theory or lack them prima materia one challenge to the conventional concept of matter as tangible stuff came with the rise of field physics in the 19th century relativity shows that matter and energy including the spatially distributed energy of fields are interchangeable this enables the ontological view that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms in contrast the standard model of particle physics uses quantum field theory to describe all interactions on this view it could be said that fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the field according to the dominant cosmological model the lambda cdm model less than 5 of the universe s energy density is made up of the matter the standard model describes and most of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy with little agreement among scientists about what these are made of with the advent of quantum physics some scientists believed the concept of matter had merely changed while others believed the conventional position could no longer be maintained werner heisenberg said the ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence the direct actuality of the world around us can be extrapolated into the atomic range this extrapolation however is impossible atoms are not things the concept of matter has changed in response to new scientific discoveries thus materialism has no definite content independent of the particular theory of matter on which it is based according to noam chomsky any property can be considered material if one defines matter such that it has that property the philosophical materialist gustavo bueno uses a more precise term than matter the stroma in materialism and empirio criticism lenin argues that the truth of dialectical materialism is unrelated to any particular understanding of matter to him such changes actually confirm the dialectical form of materialism physicalism george stack distinguishes between materialism and physicalism in the twentieth century physicalism has emerged out of positivism physicalism restricts meaningful statements to physical bodies or processes that are verifiable or in principle verifiable it is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to revision and hence lacks the dogmatic stance of classical materialism herbert feigl defended physicalism in the united states and consistently held that mental states are brain states and that mental terms have the same referent as physical terms the twentieth century has witnessed many materialist theories of the mental and much debate surrounding them but not all conceptions of physicalism are tied to verificationist theories of meaning or direct realist accounts of perception rather physicalists believe that no element of reality is missing from the mathematical formalism of our best description of the world materialist physicalists also believe that the formalism describes fields of insentience in other words the intrinsic nature of the physical is non experiential religious and spiritual views christianity hinduism and transcendental club most hindus and transcendentalists regard all matter as an illusion or maya blinding humans from the truth transcendental experiences like the perception of brahman are considered to destroy the illusion criticism and alternatives from contemporary physicists rudolf peierls a physicist who played a major role in the manhattan project rejected materialism the premise that you can describe in terms of physics the whole function of a human being including knowledge and consciousness is untenable there is still something missing erwin schr\u00f6dinger said consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms for consciousness is absolutely fundamental it cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else werner heisenberg wrote the ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence the direct actuality of the world around us can be extrapolated into the atomic range this extrapolation however is impossible atoms are not things quantum mechanics some 20th century physicists e g eugene wigner and henry stapp and some modern physicists and science writers e g stephen barr paul davies and john gribbin have argued that materialism is flawed due to certain recent findings in physics such as quantum mechanics and chaos theory according to gribbin and davies 1991 then came our quantum theory which totally transformed our image of matter the old assumption that the microscopic world of atoms was simply a scaled down version of the everyday world had to be abandoned newton s deterministic machine was replaced by a shadowy and paradoxical conjunction of waves and particles governed by the laws of chance rather than the rigid rules of causality an extension of the quantum theory goes beyond even this it paints a picture in which solid matter dissolves away to be replaced by weird excitations and vibrations of invisible field energy quantum physics undermines materialism because it reveals that matter has far less substance than we might believe but another development goes even further by demolishing newton s image of matter as inert lumps this development is the theory of chaos which has recently gained widespread attention digital physics the objections of davies and gribbin are shared by proponents of digital physics who view information rather than matter as fundamental the physicist and proponent of digital physics john archibald wheeler wrote all matter and all things physical are information theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe some founders of quantum theory such as max planck shared their objections he wrote as a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science to the study of matter i can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much there is no matter as such all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together we must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind this mind is the matrix of all matter james jeans concurred with planck saying the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter philosophical objections in the critique of pure reason immanuel kant argued against materialism in defending his transcendental idealism as well as offering arguments against subjective idealism and mind body dualism but kant argues that change and time require an enduring substrate postmodern poststructuralist thinkers also express skepticism about any all encompassing metaphysical scheme philosopher mary midgley argues that materialism is a self refuting idea at least in its eliminative materialist form varieties of idealism arguments for idealism such as those of hegel and berkeley often take the form of an argument against materialism indeed berkeley s idealism was called immaterialism now matter can be argued to be redundant as in bundle theory and mind independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts berkeley gives an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter as there is no direct experience of matter all that is experienced is perception whether internal or external as such matter s existence can only be inferred from the apparent perceived stability of perceptions it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience if matter and energy are seen as necessary to explain the physical world but incapable of explaining mind dualism results emergence holism and process philosophy seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional especially mechanistic materialism without abandoning materialism entirely materialism as methodology some critics object to materialism as part of an overly skeptical narrow or reductivist approach to theorizing rather than to the ontological claim that matter is the only substance particle physicist and anglican theologian john polkinghorne objects to what he calls promissory materialism claims that materialistic science will eventually succeed in explaining phenomena it has not so far been able to explain polkinghorne prefers dual aspect monism to materialism some scientific materialists have been criticized for failing to provide clear definitions of matter leaving the term materialism without any definite meaning noam chomsky states that since the concept of matter may be affected by new scientific discoveries as has happened in the past scientific materialists are being dogmatic in assuming the opposite see also notes references

outlets differ from old media e g newspapers tv and radio broadcasting in many ways including quality reach frequency usability relevancy and permanence social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system many sources to many receivers while traditional media operate under a monologic transmission model one source to many receivers for instance a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers including exposure to inappropriate content exploitation by adults sleep problems attention problems feelings of exclusion and various mental health maladies social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy major news outlets often have strong controls in place to avoid and fix false claims but social media s unique qualities bring viral content with little to no oversight algorithms that track user engagement to prioritize what is shown tend to favor content that spurs negative emotions like anger and outrage overall most online misinformation originates from a small minority of superspreaders but social media amplifies their reach and influence history early computing the plato system was launched in 1960 at the university of illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by control data corporation it offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as notes plato s message forum application term talk its instant messaging feature talkomatic perhaps the first online chat room news report a crowdsourced online newspaper and blog and access lists enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users for example only friends classmates or co workers arpanet which came online in 1969 had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of non government business ideas and communication as evidenced by the network etiquette or netiquette described in a 1982 handbook on computing at mit s artificial intelligence laboratory arpanet evolved into the internet in the 1990s usenet conceived by tom truscott and jim ellis in 1979 at the university of north carolina at chapel hill and duke university was the first open social media app established in 1980 a precursor of the electronic bulletin board system bbs known as community memory appeared by 1973 mainstream bbss arrived with the computer bulletin board system in chicago which launched on february 16 1978 before long most major us cities had more than one bbs running on trs 80 apple ii atari 8 bit computers ibm pc commodore 64 sinclair and others compuserve prodigy and aol were three of the largest bbs companies and were the first to migrate to the internet in the 1990s between the mid 1980s and the mid 1990s bbses numbered in the tens of thousands in north america alone message forums were the signature bbs phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s in 1991 tim berners lee integrated html hypertext software with the internet creating the world wide web this breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs list servers and email services message forums migrated to the web and evolved into internet forums supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously these early text based systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century aided by digital cameras and camera phones social media platforms the evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of web 2 0 social media started in the mid 1990s with the invention of platforms like geocities classmates com and sixdegrees com while instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time sixdegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously it boasted features like profiles friends lists and school affiliations making it the very first social networking site the platform s name was inspired by the six degrees of separation concept which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else in the early 2000s social media platforms gained widespread popularity with blackplanet 1999 preceding friendster and myspace followed by facebook youtube and twitter research from 2015 reported that globally users spent 22 of their online time on social networks likely fueled by the availability of smartphones as of 2023 as many as 4 76 billion people used social media some 59 of the global population definition a 2015 review identified four

of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets it is distinguished by its ubiquity since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer mobile services can further make use of the user s immediate location to offer information connections or services relevant to that location according to andreas kaplan mobile social media activities fall among four types space timers location and time sensitive exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time posting about a traffic jam space locators only location sensitive posts messages with relevance for a specific location read later by others e g a restaurant review quick timers only time sensitive transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy e g posting status updates slow timers neither location nor time sensitive transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices e g watching a video elements and function virality certain content has the potential to spread virally an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual one user spreads a post across their network which leads those users to follow suit a post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours virality is not guaranteed few posts make the transition viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally social media sites provide specific functionality to help users re share content such as x s and facebook s like option bots bots are automated programs that operate on the internet they automate many communication tasks this has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking commenting and following bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions some bots violate platforms terms of use which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions cyborgs either bot assisted humans or human assisted bots are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz a common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time a human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time in other cases cyborgs spread fake news cyborgs may work as sock puppets where one human pretends to be someone else or operates multiple accounts each pretending to be a person patents a multitude of united states patents are related to social media growing rapidly as of 2020 over 5000 social media patent applications had been published in the united states only slightly over 100 patents had been issued platform convergence as an instance of technological convergence various social media platforms adapted functionality beyond their original scope increasingly overlapping with each other examples are the social hub site facebook launching an integrated video platform in may 2007 and instagram whose original scope was low resolution photo sharing introducing the ability to share quarter minute 640 640 pixel videos later extended to a minute with increased resolution instagram later implemented stories short videos self destructing after 24 hours a concept popularized by snapchat as well as igtv for seekable videos stories were then adopted by youtube x whose original scope was text based microblogging later adopted photo sharing then video sharing then a media studio for business users after youtube s creator studio the discussion platform reddit added an integrated image hoster replacing the external image sharing platform imgur and then an internal video hosting service followed by image galleries multiple images in a single post known from imgur imgur implemented video sharing youtube rolled out a community feature for sharing text only posts and polls usage statistics according to statista it is estimated that in 2022 around 3 96 billion people were using social media globally this number is up from 3 6 billion in 2020 the following is a list of the most popular social networking services based on the number of active users as of january 2024 per statista usage before the pandemic a 2009 study suggested that individual differences may help explain who uses social media extraversion and openness have a positive relationship with social media while emotional stability has a negative sloping relationship with social media a 2015 study reported that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation common sense media reported that children under age 13 in the united states use social networking services although many social media sites require users to be 13 or older in 2017 the firm conducted a survey of parents of children from birth to age 8 and reported that 4 of children at this age used social media sites such as instagram snapchat or now defunct musical ly often or sometimes their 2019 survey surveyed americans ages 8 16 and reported that about 31 of children ages 8 12 use social media in that survey teens aged 16 18 were asked when they started using social media the median age was 14 although 28 said they started to use it before reaching 13 usage during the pandemic usage by minors social media played a role in communication during the covid 19 pandemic in june 2020 a survey by cartoon network and the cyberbullying research center surveyed americans tweens ages 9 12 and reported that the most popular application was youtube 67 as age increased tweens were more likely to have used social media apps and games similarly common sense media s 2020 survey of americans ages 13 18 reported that youtube was the most popular used by 86 of 13 to 18 year olds as children aged they increasingly utilized social media services and often used youtube to consume content reasons for use by adults while adults were using social media before the covid 19 pandemic more started using it to stay socially connected and to get pandemic updates social media have become popularly use to seek for medical information and have fascinated the general public to collect information regarding corona virus pandemics in various perspectives during these days people are forced to stay at home and the social media have connected and supported awareness and pandemic updates healthcare workers and systems became more aware of social media as a place people were getting health information during the covid 19 pandemic social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems this also led to the spread of disinformation on december 11 2020 the cdc put out a call to action managing the infodemic some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on their twitter data promotion of the joint usage of pedsicu and covid19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care however others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction as it became an increasingly important context and therefore source of social validation and reinforcement and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful use by organizations government governments may use social media to for example inform their opinions to public interact with citizens foster citizen participation further open government analyze monitor public opinion and activities educate the public about risks and public health law enforcement social media has been used extensively in civil and criminal investigations it has also been used to search for missing persons police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public publicize police activity and burnish law enforcement s image conversely video footage of citizen documented police brutality and other misconduct has sometimes been posted to social media in the united states u s immigration and customs enforcement identifies and track individuals via social media and has apprehended some people via social media based sting operations u s customs and border protection also known as cpb and the united states department of homeland security use social media data as influencing factors during the visa process and monitor individuals after they have entered the country cpb officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border searching both citizens and non citizens without first obtaining a warrant reputation management as social media gained momentum among the younger generations governments began using it to improve their image especially among the youth in january 2021 egyptian authorities were reported to be using instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program the program was designed to revamp egypt s image and to counter the bad press egypt had received because of the country s human rights record saudi arabia and the united arab emirates participated in similar programs similarly dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism however dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities or to criticize the city politics or religion the content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays dubai in a negative light business many businesses use social media for marketing branding advertising communication sales promotions informal employee learning organizational development competitive analysis recruiting relationship management loyalty programs and e commerce companies use social media monitoring tools to monitor track and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing sales and other programs tools range from free basic applications to subscription based tools social media offers information on industry trends within the finance industry companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment these range from marketing financial products market trends and as a tool to identify insider trading to exploit these opportunities businesses need guidelines for use on each platform business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence instead it makes its case by participating in the conversation business uses social media on a customer organizational level and an intra organizational level social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by highlighting successes and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily available known marketing social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections with customers social media marketing can be divided into paid media earned media and owned media using paid social media firms run advertising on a social media platform earned social media appears when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it owned social media is the platform markets itself by creating promoting content to its users primary uses are to create brand awareness engage customers by conversation e g customers provide feedback on the firm and providing access to customer service social media s peer to peer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company social media personalities often referred to as influencers are internet celebrities who are sponsored by marketers to promote products and companies online research reports that these endorsements attract the attention of users who have not settled on which products services to buy especially younger consumers the practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as influencer marketing in 2013 the united kingdom advertising standards authority asa began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag spon or ad when endorsing the us federal trade commission issued similar guidelines social media platforms also enable targeting specific audiences with advertising users of social media can share and comment on the advertisement turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users companies can use humor such as shitposting to poke fun at competitors advertising can even inspire fanart which can engage new audiences hashtags such as ejuice and eliquid are one way to target interested users user content can trigger peer effects increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement a 2012 study focused on this communication reported that communication among peers can affect purchase intentions direct impact through encouraging conformity and an indirect impact by increasing product engagement this study claimed that peer communication about a product increased product engagement politics social media have a range of uses in politics politicians use social media to spread their messages and influence voters dounoucos et al reported that twitter use by candidates was unprecedented during the us 2016 election the public increased its reliance on social media sites for political information in the european union social media amplified political messages foreign originated social media campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country activism social media was influential in the arab spring in 2011 however debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this activists have used social media to report the abuse of human rights in bahrain they publicized the brutality of government authorities who they claimed were detaining torturing and threatening individuals conversely bahrain s government used social media to track and target activists the government stripped citizenship from over 1 000 activists as punishment militant groups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool islamic state also known as isis used social media in 2014 alleyesonisis went viral on arabic x propaganda recruiting science scientists use social media to share their scientific knowledge and research on platforms such as researchgate linkedin facebook x and academia edu the most common platforms are x and blogs the use of social media reportedly has improved the interaction between scientists reporters and the general public over 495 000 opinions were shared on x related to science between september 1 2010 and august 31 2011 science related blogs respond to and motivate public interest in learning following and discussing science posts can be written quickly and allow the reader to interact in real time with authors one study in the context of climate change reported that climate scientists and scientific institutions played a minimal role in online debate exceeded by nongovernmental organizations academia academicians use social media activity to assess academic publications to measure public sentiment identify influencer accounts or crowdsource ideas or solutions social media such as facebook x are also combined to predict elections via sentiment analysis additional social media e g youtube google trends can be combined to reach a wider segment of the voting population minimise media specific bias and inexpensively estimate electoral predictions which are on average half of a percentage point off the real vote share school admissions in some places

tampered with judges may consider emojis into account to assess statements made on social media in one michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment the judge disagreed noting that an emoji after the comment that indicated that it was a joke in a 2014 case in ontario against a police officer regarding alleged assault of a protester during the g20

for education cultural preservation and other social programs use by individuals news source social tool social media are used to socialize with friends and family pursue romance and flirt but not all social needs can be fulfilled by social media for example a 2003 article reported that lonely individuals are more likely to use the internet for emotional support than others a 2018 survey from common sense media reported that 40 of american teens ages 13 17 thought that social media was extremely or very important for them to connect with their friends the same survey reported that 33 of teens said social media was extremely or very important to conduct meaningful conversations with close friends and 23 of teens said social media was extremely or very important to document and share their lives a 2020 gallup poll reported that 53 of adult social media users in the united states thought that social media was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with people during the covid 19 pandemic in alone together sherry turkle considered how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication she claimed that people act differently online and are less concerned about hurting others feelings some online encounters can cause stress and anxiety due to the difficulty purging online posts fear of getting hacked or of universities and employers exploring social media pages turkle speculated that many people prefer texting to face to face communication which can contribute to loneliness surveys from 2019 reported evidence among teens in the united states and mexico some researchers reported that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocal messages correlated with less loneliness in social media stalking or creeping refers to looking at someone s timeline status updates tweets and online bios to find information about them and their activities a sub category of creeping is creeping ex partners after a breakup catfishing creating a false identity allows bad actors to exploit the lonely invidious comparison self presentation theory proposes that people consciously manage their self image or identity related information in social contexts one aspect of social media is the time invested in customizing a personal profile some users segment their audiences based on the image they want to present pseudonymity and use of multiple accounts on the same platform offer that opportunity a 2016 study reported that teenage girls manipulate their self presentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance likes comments and shares when this does not go well self confidence and self satisfaction can decline a 2018 survey of american teens ages 13 17 by common sense media reported that 45 said likes are at least somewhat important and 26 at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain and some may resort to online bullying according to a 2016 study users reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers a 2016 review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos self comparison disappointment and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved one 2016 study reported that pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior people portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way however upon seeing one person s curated persona other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling one 2017 study reported that problematic social media use i e feeling addicted to social media was related to lower life satisfaction and self esteem studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health in one study women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction while men reported them as the second biggest factor while monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with one s own may increase their impact a 2021 study reported that 87 of women and 65 of men compared themselves to others on social media efforts to combat such negative effects focused promoting body positivity in a related study women aged 18 30 were reported posts that contained side by side images of women in the same clothes and setting but one image was enhanced for instagram while the other was an unedited realistic version women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction health adolescents social media can offer a support system for adolescent health because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant for example in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing obesity treatment participants claimed that social media allowed them to access personalized weight loss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity while social media can provide health information it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information the national eating disorders association reported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content health literacy offers skills to allow users to spot avoid such content efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success the role of parents and caregivers who proactively approach their children with ongoing guidance and open discussions on the benefits and difficulties they may encounter online demonstrate some reductions in overall anxiety and depression among adolescents social media such as pro anorexia sites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging health related behaviors through social media especially among adolescents pandemic during the coronavirus pandemic inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media topics subject to distortion included treatments avoiding infection vaccination and public policy simultaneously governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories leading to worse mental health and less compliance with public health recommendations addiction social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addiction related behaviors with studies report that excessive use can lead to addiction like symptoms these symptoms include compulsive checking mood modification and withdrawal when not using social media which can result in decreased face to face social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness cyberbullying sleep disturbance a 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media it concluded that blue light from computer phone displays and the frequency rather than the duration of time spent predicted disturbed sleep termed obsessive checking the association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults a recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance the median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61 females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones and this left them tired and unfocused in school a 2011 study reported that time spent on facebook was negatively associated with gpa but the association with sleep disturbance was not established emotional effects one studied effect of social media is facebook depression which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media this may lead to reclusiveness which can increase loneliness and low self esteem social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling studies report children s self esteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments this affected self perception a 2017 study of almost 6 000 adolescent students reported that those who self reported addiction like symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low self esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms a second emotional effect is social media burnout defined as ambivalence emotional exhaustion and depersonalization ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media the three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media a third emotional effect is fear of missing out fomo which is the pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent it is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media social media can also offer support as twitter has done for the medical community x facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes comments and posts access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones in march 2025 a pakistani man killed a whatsapp group admin in anger after being removed from the chat social impacts media critic siva vaidhyanathan refers to social media as anti social media in reference to its negative impacts including on loneliness and political polarization audrey tang also uses the term antisocial in reference to its impact on democracy disparity political polarization many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them jonathan haidt compared the impact of social media to the tower of babel and the chaos it unleashed as a result aviv ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content but could be designed to reduce polarization instead in 2017 facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity misinformation and low quality news some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts some advocate for media literacy as a solution others argue that less social media or more local journalism could help address political polarization stereotyping a 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations for example during the covid 19 pandemic youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media social media platforms usually amplify these stereotypes by reinforcing age based biases through certain algorithms as well as user generated content unfortunately these stereotypes contribute to social divide and negatively impact the way users interact online communication social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication despite different ways of communicating in various cultures social media has affected the way youth communicate by introducing new forms of language novel acronyms save time as illustrated by lol which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud the hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion for some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media the american academy of pediatrics reported that bullying the making of non inclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk however adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities regulation by government authorities situation by geographical region australia in july 2014 in response to wikileaks release of a secret suppression order made by the victorian supreme court media lawyers were quoted in the australian media to the effect that anyone who tweets a link to the wikileaks report posts it on facebook or shares it in any way online could also face charges in november 2024 the federal government passed the online safety amendment social media minimum age bill 2024 introduced by the albanese government banning people under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms which would come into effect in late 2025 presented by minister for communications michelle rowland the bill was created as an attempt at reducing social media harms for young people and responding to the concerns of parents the stated penalty for breach of the new laws on the part of social media platforms was a financial penalty of au 49 5 million the ban would apply to many major social media platforms including tiktok instagram snapchat and twitter but would exempt platforms deemed to meet educational or health needs of people under 16 including youtube and google classroom supporters of the ban included the advocacy group 36 months and media corporation news corp australia which ran a campaign titled let them be kids whilst opposers expressed concern that the ban could cause isolation amongst teenagers belonging to marginalised groups such as the lgbtq community or migrant culturally diverse backgrounds and that the ban could stifle creativity and freedom of expression amongst young people egypt on 27 july 2020 in egypt two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting tiktok videos which the government claimed as violating family values thailand in the 2014 thai coup d \u00e9tat the public was explicitly instructed not to share or like dissenting views on social media or face prison united states historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented they set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore the us enacted the communications decency act in 1996 section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 47 u s c 230 c 1 in 2024 legislation was enacted in florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14 and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval european union the european union initially took a similar approach however in 2020 the european commission presented two legislative proposals the digital services act dsa and the digital markets act dma both proposals were enacted in july 2022 the dsa entered into force on 17 february 2024 the dma in march 2024 this legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by meps what is illegal offline must also be illegal online very large online platforms must therefore among other things delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the european commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising violators could face a complete ban in europe or fines of up to 6 of global sales such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance the dsa allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction according to patrick breyer from the german pirate party a problem could arise from the hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of victor orban as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied eu wide discussions and proposals general 2018 nobel laureate paul romer advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms similar to a carbon tax negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them however consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax another proposal is to invoke competition law the idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law this would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines in a 2024 opinion piece megan moreno and jenny radesky professors of pediatrics wrote about the need for nuanced policy they regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful they commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages united states in june 2024 us surgeon general vivek murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people business models the business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver ads that are individually relevant to them this strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see platforms such as x add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues criticism debate and controversy the enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability impact on concentration mental health content ownership and the meaning of interactions and poor cross platform interoperability decrease in face to face interactions cyberbullying sexual predation particularly of children and child pornography in 2007 andrew keen wrote out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the internet was the law of digital darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering trustworthiness and reliability social media has become a regular source of news and information a 2021 pew research center poll reported roughly 70 of users regularly get news from social media despite the presence of fake news and misinformation platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy and many do not vet content at all although in some cases content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance responding instead to the contents virality in 2018 researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70 faster than truthful news on x social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users some platforms attempt to discover and block bots with limited success fake news seems to receive more user engagement possibly because it is relatively novel engaging users curiosity and increasing spread fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event before conventional media are prepared to publish data harvesting and data mining critique of activism malcolm gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated he concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves that expression likely has no impact beyond social media what he called high risk activism involves strong relationships coordination commitment high risks and sacrifice gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that social networks are effective at increasing participation by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires according to him facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice disputing gladwell s theory a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity content ownership social media content is generated by users however content ownership is defined by the terms of service to which users agree platforms control access to the content and may make it available to third parties although platform s terms differ generally they all give permission to utilize users copyrighted works at the platform s discretion after its acquisition by facebook in 2012 instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users it then reversed these changes with then ceo kevin systrom promising to update the terms of service privacy privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data information is captured without the user s knowing consent data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes information may be offered for third party use young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators while social media users claim to want to keep their data private their behavior does not reflect that concern as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles in addition platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles this data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising a 2014 pew research center survey reported that 91 of americans agree or strongly agree that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used some 80 of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms and 64 said the government should do more to regulate advertisers in 2019 uk legislators criticized facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data in 2019 the pentagon issued guidance to the military coast guard and other government agencies that identified the potential risk associated with using the tiktok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information as a result the military coast guard transportation security administration and department of homeland security banned the installation and use of tiktok on government devices in 2020 the us government attempted to ban tiktok and wechat from the states over national security concerns however a federal court blocked the move in 2024 the us congress passed a law directing tiktok s parent company bytedance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the us the company sued challenging the constitutionality of the ban the ban was upheld as constitutional addiction research suggests that social media platforms trigger a cycle of compulsive behavior which reinforces addictive patterns and makes it harder for individuals to break the cycle various lawsuits have been brought regarding social media addiction such as the multi district litigation alleging harms caused by social media addiction on young users debate over use by young people whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous a study of americans aged 12 15 reported that teenagers who used social media over three hours day doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content a 2023 study of australian youth reported that 57 had seen disturbingly violent content while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images further youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullying as result phones have been banned from some schools and some schools in the us have blocked social media websites intense discussions are taking place regarding the imposition of certain restrictions on children s access to social media it is argued that using social media at a young age brings with it many problems for example according to a survey conducted by ofcom the media regulator in the uk 22 of children aged 8 17 lie about being over 18 on social media according to a system implemented in norway more than half of nine year olds and the vast majority of 12 year olds spend time on social media a series of measures have begun to be taken across europe to prevent the risks caused by such problems the countries that have taken concrete steps in this regard are norway and france since june 2023 france has started requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of their users and to obtain parental consent for those under the age of 15 in norway there is a minimum age requirement of 13 to access social media the online safety law in the uk has given social media platforms until mid 2025 to strengthen their age verification systems censorship social media often features in political struggles in some countries internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens use of social media for example in 2013 some social media was banned in turkey after the taksim gezi park protests both x and youtube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court s decision a law granted immunity to telecommunications directorate ti b personnel the ti b was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order yet ti b s 2014 blocking of x was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech united states decentralization and open standards while the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable open source protocols such as activitypub have been adopted by platforms such as mastodon gnu social diaspora and friendica they operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteer operated servers called the fediverse however in 2019 mastodon blocked gab from connecting to it claiming that it spread violent right wing extremism in december 2019 x ceo jack dorsey advocated an open and decentralized standard for social media he joined bluesky to bring it to reality deplatforming threat to democracy a number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on zack beauchamp of vox media calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats the economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats informed dialogue a shared sense of reality mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media political polarization can be one byproduct this can have implications for the likelihood of political violence siva vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing anti trust laws andrew leonard describes pol is as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus extremist groups according to likewar the weaponization of social media the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities corporations and governments but also extremist groups the use of social media by isis and al qaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers social media platforms and encrypted messaging applications have been used to recruit members both locally and internationally platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content extreme nationalist groups and more prominently us right wing extremists have used similar online tactics as many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech several platforms became popular among right wing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events these application became known as alt tech platforms such as telegram parler and gab were used during the january 6 united states capitol attack to coordinate attacks members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians deceased users social media content persists unless the user deletes it after a user dies unless the platform is notified their content remains each platform has created guidelines for this situation in most cases on social media the platforms require a next of kin to prove that the user is deceased and give them the option of closing the account or

at wikimedia commons", "Social criticism": "social criticism is a form of academic or journalistic criticism focusing on social issues in contemporary society in respect to perceived injustices and power relations in general social criticism of the enlightenment the origin of modern social criticism go back at least to the age of enlightenment according to the historian jonathan israel the roots of the radical enlightenment can be found in spinoza and his circle radical enlighteners like jean meslier were not satisfied with the social criticism of the time which was essentially a criticism of religion the focus of his criticism was the suffering of the peasants in addition there was also a criticism of civilization for religious reasons such as that which emanated from the quakers in england jean jacques rousseau developed a social criticism in his political philosophy which influenced the french revolution and in his pedagogy academic forms the positivism dispute between critical rationalism e g between karl popper and the frankfurt school dealt with the question of whether research in the social sciences should be neutral or consciously adopt a partisan view academic works of social criticism can belong to social philosophy political economy sociology social psychology psychoanalysis but also cultural studies and other disciplines or reject academic forms of discourse in literature and music social criticism can be expressed in a fictional form e g in a revolutionary novel like the iron heel 1908 by jack london in dystopian novels like aldous huxley s brave new world 1932 george orwell s nineteen eighty four 1949 ray bradbury s fahrenheit 451 1953 amd rafael grugman s nontraditional love 2008 or in children s books or films according to frederick douglass where justice is denied where poverty is enforced where ignorance prevails and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress rob and degrade them neither persons nor property will be safe fictional literature can have a significant social impact for example the 1852 novel uncle tom s cabin by harriet beecher stowe furthered the anti slavery movement in the united states and the 1885 novel ramona by helen hunt jackson brought about changes in laws regarding native americans similarly upton sinclair s 1906 novel the jungle helped create new laws related to public health and food handling and arthur morrison s 1896 novel a child of the jago caused england to change its housing laws charles dickens and orwell respectively wrotea tale of two cities and animal farm to express their disillusionment with society and human nature a tale of two cities typifies this kind of literature besides the central theme of love is another prevalent theme that of a revolution gone bad dickens shows that human nature causes humans to be vengeful and at time overly ambitious both of these books are similar in that both describe how even with the best of intentions human ambitions get the best of them animal farm written in 1944 is a book that tells the animal fable of a farm in which the farm animals revolt against their human masters it is an example of social criticism in literature in which orwell satirized the events in russia after the bolshevik revolution he anthropomorphizes the animals and alludes each one to a counterpart in russian history both authors also demonstrate that violence and the machiavellian attitude of the ends justifying the means are deplorable they also express their authors disenchantment with the state of evolution of human nature dickens and orwell imply that even if humans begin with honourable intentions there will be some who will let their basic instincts take control in a tale of two cities dickens examines the inner soul and shares with us how people are driven to the valley of human emotions where desperation and anger reign and what could happen afterwards if we let these emotions build up inside every human being is capable of becoming a ruthless opportunistic being like napoleon or madame defarge if placed in the right place at the right time animal farm portrays this nature through parodying events in real history given the right conditions these events could happen anywhere for example a leader becoming overly ambitious to the point of harming his people for more power social criticism is present in opera e g the cradle will rock or trouble in tahiti and other types of classical music such as the symphony no 13 called babi yar of dmitri shostakovich other musical expressions of social criticism are frequent in punk and rap music examples being pretty vacant by sex pistols and brenda s got a baby by 2pac heavy metal and industrial rock bands such as black sabbath metallica marilyn manson nine inch nails and megadeth also use social criticism extensively particularly in their earlier works literature classical writings \u00e9tienne de la bo\u00e9tie

inequality": "social inequality occurs when resources within a society are distributed unevenly often as a result of inequitable allocation practices that create distinct unequal patterns based on socially defined categories of people differences in accessing social goods within society are influenced by factors like power religion kinship prestige race ethnicity gender age sexual orientation intelligence and class social inequality usually implies the lack of equality of outcome but may alternatively be conceptualized as a lack of equality in access to opportunity social inequality is linked to economic inequality usually described as the basis of the unequal distribution of income or wealth although the disciplines of economics and sociology generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality both fields are actively involved in researching this inequality however social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to social status norms of allocation can also affect the distribution of rights and privileges social power access to public goods such as education or the judicial system adequate housing transportation credit and financial services such as banking and other social goods and services overview social inequality is shaped by a range of structural factors such as geographical location or citizenship status and is often underpinned by cultural discourses and identities defining for example whether the poor are deserving or undeserving understanding the process of social inequality highlights the importance of how society values its people and identifies significant aspects of how biases manifest within society in simple societies those that have few social roles and statuses occupied by its members social inequality may be very low in tribal societies for example a tribal head or chieftain may hold some privileges use some tools or wear marks of office to which others do not have access but the daily life of the chieftain is very much like the daily life of any other tribal member anthropologists identify such highly egalitarian cultures as kinship oriented which appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status these cultures are contrasted with materially oriented cultures in which status and wealth are prized and competition and conflict are common kinship oriented cultures may actively work to prevent social hierarchies from developing because they believe that could lead to conflict and instability as social complexity increases so can social inequality as it tends to increase along with a widening gap between the poorest and the most wealthy members of society social inequality can be classified into egalitarian societies ranked society and stratified society egalitarian societies are those communities advocating for social equality through equal opportunities and rights hence no discrimination people with special skills were not viewed as superior compared to the rest the leaders do not have the power they only have influence the norms and the beliefs the egalitarian society holds are for sharing equally and equal participation simply there are no classes ranked society mostly is agricultural communities who hierarchically grouped from the chief who is viewed to have a status in the society in this society people are clustered regarding status and prestige and not by access to power and resources the chief is the most influential person followed by his family and relative and those further related to him are less ranked stratified society is societies which horizontally ranked into the upper class middle class and lower class the classification is regarding wealth power and prestige the upper class are mostly the leaders and are the most influential in the society it s possible for a person in the society to move from one stratum to the other the social status is also hereditable from one generation to the next there are five systems or types of social inequality wealth inequality treatment and responsibility inequality political inequality life inequality and membership inequality political inequality is the difference brought about by the ability to access governmental resources which therefore have no civic equality in treatment and responsibility differences most people can benefit more and access privileges than others this occurs in a system where dominance is present in working stations some are given more responsibilities and hence better compensation and more benefits than the rest even when equally qualified membership inequality is the number of members in a family nation or faith life inequality is brought about by the disparity of opportunities which if present improve a person s life quality finally income and wealth inequality is the disparity due to what an individual can earn on a daily basis contributing to their total revenue either monthly or yearly status in society is of two types which are ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics ascribed characteristics are those present at birth or assigned by others and over which an individual has little or no control examples include sex skin colour eye shape place of birth sexuality gender identity parentage and social status of parents achieved characteristics are those which a person earns or chooses examples include level of education marital status leadership status and other measures of merit in most societies an individual s social status is a combination of ascribed and achieved factors in some societies however only ascribed statuses are considered in seeking and determining one s social status and there exists little to no social mobility and therefore few paths to more social equality this type of social inequality is generally referred to as caste inequality one s social location in a society s overall structure of social stratification affects and is affected by almost every aspect of social life and one s life chances the single best predictor of an individual s future social status is the social status into which they were born theoretical approaches to explaining social inequality concentrate on questions about how such social differentiations arise what types of resources are being allocated what are the roles of human cooperation and conflict in allocating resources and how do these differing types and forms of inequality affect the overall functioning of a society the variables considered are greatly important in how the explanation of inequality is in manner and in which those variables combine to produce the inequities and their social consequences in a given society can change across time and place in addition to interest in comparing and contrasting social inequality at local and national levels in the wake of today s globalizing processes the most interesting question becomes what does inequality look like on a worldwide scale and what does such global inequality bode for the future in effect globalization reduces the distances of time and space producing a global interaction of cultures and societies and social roles that can increase global inequities inequality and ideology philosophical questions about social ethics and the desirability or inevitability of inequality in human societies have given rise to a spate of ideologies to address such questions by looking at the inequality of the given situations that are present we identify the source of how inequality can rise up and substantiate a rise in how we view life we can define this significant aspect as it classifies these ideologies on the basis of whether they justify or legitimize inequality casting it as desirable or inevitable or whether they cast equality as desirable and inequality as a feature of society to be reduced or eliminated one end of this ideological continuum can be called individualist the other collectivist in western societies there is a long history associated with the idea of individual ownership of property and economic liberalism the ideological belief in organizing the economy on individualist lines such that the greatest possible number of economic decisions are made by individuals and not by collective institutions or organizations laissez faire free market ideologies including classical liberalism neoliberalism and right libertarianism are formed around the idea that social inequality is a natural feature of societies is therefore inevitable and in some philosophies even desirable inequality provides for differing goods and services to be offered on the open market spurs ambition and provides incentive for industriousness and innovation at the other end of the continuum collectivists place little to no trust in free market economic systems noting widespread lack of access among specific groups or classes of individuals to the costs of entry to the market widespread inequalities often lead to conflict and dissatisfaction with the current social order such ideologies include fabianism and socialism inequality in these ideologies must be reduced eliminated or kept under tight control through collective regulation furthermore in some views inequality is natural but shouldn t affect certain fundamental human needs human rights and the initial chances given to individuals e g by education and is out of proportions due to various problematic systemic structures the economic grievance thesis argues that economic factors such as deindustrialisation economic liberalisation and deregulation are causing the formation of a left behind precariat with low job security high inequality and wage stagnation who then support populism some theories only focus on the effect of economic crises or inequality another objection for economic reasons is due to the globalization that is taking place in the world today in addition to criticism of the widening inequality caused by the elite the widening inequality among the general public caused by the influx of immigrants and other factors due to globalization is also a target of populist criticism the evidence of increasing economic disparity and volatility of family incomes is clear particularly in the united states as shown by the work of thomas piketty and others commentators such as martin wolf emphasize the importance of economics they warn that such trends increase resentment and make people susceptible to populist rhetoric evidence for this is mixed at the macro level political scientists report that xenophobia anti immigrant feeling and resentment towards out groups tend to be higher during difficult economic times economic crises have been associated with gains by far right political parties however there is little evidence at the micro or individual level to link individual economic grievances and populist support populist politicians tend to put pressure on central bank independence though the above discussion is limited to specific western ideologies similar thinking can be found historically in differing societies throughout the world while in general eastern societies tend toward collectivism elements of individualism and free market organization can be found in certain regions and historical eras classic chinese society in the han and tang dynasties for example while highly organized into tight hierarchies of horizontal inequality with a distinct power elite also had many elements of free trade among its various regions and subcultures social mobility is the movement along social strata or hierarchies by individuals ethnic group or nations there is a change in literacy income distribution education and health status the movement can be vertical or horizontal vertical is the upward or downward movement along social strata which occurs due to change of jobs or marriage horizontal movement along levels that are equally ranked intra generational mobility is a social status change in a generation single lifetime for example a person moves from a junior staff in an organization to the senior management the absolute management movement is where a person gains better social status than their parents and this can be due to improved security economic development and better education system relative mobility is where some individual are expected to have higher social ranks than their parents today there is belief held by some that social inequality often creates political conflict and growing consensus that political structures determine the solution for such conflicts under this line of thinking adequately designed social and political institutions are seen as ensuring the smooth functioning of economic markets such that there is political stability which improves the long term outlook enhances labour and capital productivity and so stimulates economic growth with higher economic growth net gains are positive across all levels and political reforms are easier to sustain this may explain why over time in more egalitarian societies fiscal performance is better stimulating greater accumulation of capital and higher growth inequality and social class socioeconomic status ses is a combined total measure of a person s work experience and of an individual s or family s economic and social position in relation to others based on income education and occupation the importance of this has included the different ways that sources have produced multiple effects on the interpretation of women s social classes and its used throughout society it is often used as synonymous with social class a set of hierarchical social categories that indicate an individual s or household s relative position in a stratified matrix of social relationships social class is delineated by a number of variables some of which change across time and place for karl marx there exist two major social classes with significant inequality between the two the two are delineated by their relationship to the means of production in a given society those two classes are defined as the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labour to the owners of the means of production in capitalistic societies the two classifications represent the opposing social interests of its members capital gain for the capitalists and good wages for the labourers creating social conflict max weber uses social classes to examine wealth and status for him social class is strongly associated with prestige and privileges it may explain social reproduction the tendency of social classes to remain stable across generations maintaining most of their inequalities as well such inequalities include differences in income wealth access to education pension levels social status socioeconomic safety net in general social class can be defined as a large category of similarly ranked people located in a hierarchy and distinguished from other large categories in the hierarchy by such traits as occupation education income and wealth in modern western societies inequalities are often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class upper class middle class and lower class each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes e g upper middle members of different classes have varied access to financial resources which affects their placement in the social stratification system class race and gender are forms of stratification that bring inequality and determines the difference in allocation of societal rewards occupation is the primary determinant of a person class since it affects their lifestyle opportunities culture and kind of people one associates with class based families include the lower class who are the poor in the society they have limited opportunities working class are those people in blue collar jobs and usually affects the economic level of a nation the middle classes are those who rely mostly on wives employment and depends on credits from the bank and medical coverage the upper middle class are professionals who are strong because of economic resources and supportive institutions additionally the upper class usually are the wealthy families who have economic power due to accumulative wealth from families but not and not hard earned income social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of society about social class wealth political influence a society can be politically stratified based on authority and power economically stratified based on income level and wealth occupational stratification about one s occupation some roles for examples doctors engineers lawyers are highly ranked and thus they give orders while the rest receive the orders there are three systems of social stratification which are the caste system estates system and class system castes system usually ascribed to children during birth whereby one receives the same stratification as of that of their parents the stratification may be superior or inferior and thus influences the occupation and the social roles assigned to a person estate system is a state or society where people in this state were required to work on their land to receive some services like military protection communities ranked according to the nobility of their lords the class system is about income inequality and socio political status people can move the classes when they increase their level of income or if they have authority people are expected to maximize their innate abilities and possessions social stratification characteristics include its universal social ancient it s in diverse forms and also consequential the quantitative variables most often used as an indicator of social inequality are income and wealth in a given society the distribution of individual or household accumulation of wealth tells us more about variation in well being than does income alone gross domestic product gdp especially per capita gdp is sometimes used to describe economic inequality at the international or global level a better measure at that level however is the gini coefficient a measure of statistical dispersion used to represent the distribution of a specific quantity such as income or wealth at a global level among a nation s residents or even within a metropolitan area other widely used measures of economic inequality are the percentage of people living with under us 1 25 or 2 a day and the share of national income held by the wealthiest 10 of the population sometimes called the palma measure meritocracy and social inequality many societies worldwide claim to be meritocracies that is their societies exclusively distribute resources on the basis of merit the term meritocracy was coined by michael young in his 1958 dystopian essay the rise of the meritocracy to demonstrate the social dysfunctions that he anticipated arising in societies where the elites believe that they are successful entirely on the basis of merit so the adoption of this term into english without negative connotations is ironic young was concerned that the tripartite system of education being practised in the united kingdom at the time he wrote the essay considered merit to be intelligence plus effort its possessors identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education and that the obsession with quantification test scoring and qualifications it supported would create an educated middle class elite at the expense of the education of the working class inevitably resulting in injustice and eventually revolution although merit matters to some degree in many societies research shows that the distribution of resources in societies often follows hierarchical social categorizations of persons to a degree too significant to warrant calling these societies meritocratic since even exceptional intelligence talent or other forms of merit may not be compensatory for the social disadvantages people face in many cases social inequality is linked to racial and ethnic inequality gender inequality and other forms of social status and these forms can be related to corruption the most common metric for comparing social inequality in different nations is the gini coefficient which measures the concentration of wealth and income in a nation from 0 evenly distributed wealth and income to 1 one person has all wealth and income two nations may have identical gini coefficients but dramatically different economic output and or quality of life so the gini coefficient must be contextualized for meaningful comparisons to be made patterns of inequality in the economic world there are a number of socially defined characteristics of individuals that contribute to social status and therefore equality or inequality within a society when researchers use quantitative variables such as income or wealth to measure inequality on an examination of the data patterns are found that indicate these other social variables contribute to income or wealth as intervening variables significant inequalities in income and wealth are found when specific socially defined categories of people are compared among the most pervasive of these variables are sex gender race and ethnicity as they contribute to great factors in society as they form and limit many parts of the economy this is not to say in societies wherein merit is considered to be the primary factor determining one s place or rank in the social order that merit has no effect on variations in income or wealth it is to say that these other socially defined characteristics can and often do intervene in the valuation of merit gender inequality gender as a social inequality is whereby women and men are treated differently due to masculinity and femininity by dividing labor assigning roles and responsibilities and allocating social rewards sex and gender based prejudice and discrimination called sexism are major contributing factors to social inequality most societies even agricultural ones have some sexual division of labour and gender based division of labour tends to increase during industrialization the emphasis on gender inequality is born out of the deepening division in the roles assigned to men and women particularly in the economic political and educational spheres women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes in most states in both the global north and global south gender discrimination especially concerning the lower social status of women has been a topic of serious discussion not only within academic and activist communities but also by governmental agencies and international bodies such as the united nations these discussions seek to identify and remedy widespread institutionalized barriers to access for women in their societies by making use of gender analysis researchers try to understand the social expectations responsibilities resources and priorities of women and men within a specific context examining the social economic and environmental factors which influence their roles and decision making capacity by enforcing artificial separations between the social and economic roles of men and women many lives of women and girls have been negatively impacted and this has a significant aspect on them this also may lead into the ways that it can also have an effect of limiting social and economic development the cultural ideals about women s work can also affect men whose outward gender expression is considered feminine within a given society transgender and gender variant persons may express their gender through their appearance the statements they make or official documents they present in this context gender normativity which is understood as the social expectations placed on us when we present particular bodies produces widespread cultural institutional devaluations of trans identities homosexuality and femininity trans persons in particular have been defined as socially unproductive and disruptive a variety of global issues like hiv aids illiteracy and poverty have been occurring and are becoming a great aspect throughout society as it lacks the importance as women s issues since women are disproportionately affected throughout this issues women s health is at risk which causes a lot of issue in the long term run in many countries women and girls face problems such as lack of access to education which limit their opportunities to succeed and further limits their ability to seek many contributions to contribute to society in economical ways women are underrepresented and are seen are down valued within their significance in political activities and decision making processes within different countries and the establishments throughout most of the world as of 2007 around 20 percent of women were below the 1 25 day international poverty line and 40 percent below the 2 day mark more than one quarter of females under the age of 25 were below the 1 25 day international poverty line and about half on less than 2 day women s participation in work has been increasing globally but women are still facing great issues with regards to their wage discrepancies and the differences made in comparison to what men earn this is true globally as it is seen in the agricultural and rural sectors that are shown in non developed as well as developing countries this has also been seen in multiple countries and has been caused by the lack of participation that women are struggling to implement structural impediments to women s ability to pursue and advance in their chosen professions often result in a phenomenon known as the glass ceiling which refers to unseen and often unacknowledged barriers that prevent minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder regardless of their qualifications or achievements this effect can be seen in the corporate and bureaucratic environments of many countries lowering the chances of women to excel it prevents women from succeeding and making the maximum use of their potential which is at a cost for women as well as the society s development ensuring that women s rights are protected and endorsed can promote a sense of belonging that motivates women to contribute to their society once able to work women should be titled and should contribute to the same job positionings that are opposed to men and as a sense as they can also come within jobs that have the same work environment as men do until such safeguards are in place women and girls will and have always continued to experience not only barriers to work and opportunities to earn but will continue to be the primary victims of discrimination oppression and gender based violence as demonstrated within multiple nations and productions of the world we can identify the significance that this may lead into bringing the global parts of society women and persons whose gender identity does not conform to patriarchal beliefs about sex only male and female continue to face violence on global domestic interpersonal institutional and administrative scales while first wave liberal feminist initiatives raised awareness about the lack of fundamental rights and freedoms that women have access to second wave feminism see also radical feminism highlighted the structural forces that underlie gender based violence masculinities are generally constructed so as to subordinate femininities and other expressions of gender that are not heterosexual assertive and dominant the way that the production of masculinity is sourced out throughout society and has developed great incline within the institutions that are constructed of it of gender sociologist and author raewyn connell discusses in her 2009 book gender how masculinity is dangerous heterosexual violent and authoritative these structures of masculinity ultimately contribute to the vast amounts of gendered violence marginalization and suppression that women queer transgender gender variant and gender non conforming persons face some scholars suggest that women s underrepresentation in political systems speaks the idea that formal citizenship does not always imply full social membership men male bodies and expressions of masculinity are linked to ideas about work and citizenship others point out that patriarchal states tend top scale and claw back their social policies relative to the disadvantage of women this process ensures that women encounter resistance into meaningful positions of power in institutions administrations and political systems and communities racial and ethnic inequality racial or ethnic inequality is the result of hierarchical social distinctions between racial and ethnic categories within a society and often established based on characteristics such as skin color and other physical characteristics or an individual s place of origin racial inequality occurs due to racism and systemic racism racial inequality can also result in diminished opportunities for members of marginalized groups as a result of this process it can in turn lead to cycles of poverty and political marginalization a prime example of this is redlining in chicago where redlines would be drawn on maps around black neighborhoods specifically for the purpose of not allowing them out of run down public housing by not giving loans to black people in 1863 two years prior to emancipation black people in the u s owned 0 5 percent of the national wealth while in 2019 it is just over 1 5 percent racial and ethnic categories become a minority category in a society minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies including assimilation exclusion oppression expulsion and extermination for example during the run up to the 2012 federal elections in the united states legislation in certain battleground states that claimed to target voter fraud had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of primarily african american voters these types of institutional barriers to full and equal social participation have far reaching effects within marginalized communities including reduced economic opportunity and output reduced educational outcomes and opportunities and reduced levels of overall health in the united states angela davis argues that mass incarceration has been a modern tool of the state to impose inequality repression and discrimination upon african americans and hispanics see race in the united states criminal justice system the war on drugs has been a campaign with disparate effects ensuring the constant incarceration of poor vulnerable and marginalized populations in north america over a million african americans are incarcerated in the us many of whom have been convicted of a non violent drug possession charge with the states of colorado and washington having legalized the possession of marijuana lobbyists for drug liberalization are hopeful that drug issues will be interpreted and dealt with from a healthcare perspective instead of a matter of criminal law in canada aboriginal first nations and indigenous persons represent over a quarter of the federal prison population even though they only represent 3 of the country s population age inequality age discrimination is defined as the unfair treatment of people with regard to promotions recruitment resources or privileges because of their age it is also known as ageism the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals or groups based upon their age it is a set of beliefs attitudes norms and values are used to justify age based prejudice discrimination and subordination which results in ways that limits certain individuals from a set of quality one form of ageism is adultism which is the discrimination against children and people under the legal adult age an example of an act of adultism might be the policy of a certain establishment restaurant or place of business to not allow those under the legal adult age to enter their premises after a certain time or at all while some people may benefit or enjoy these practices some find them offensive and discriminatory discrimination against those under the age of 40 however is not illegal under the current u s age discrimination in employment act adea as implied in the definitions above treating people differently based upon their age is not necessarily discrimination virtually every society has age stratification meaning that the age structure in a society changes as people begin to live longer and the population becomes older in most cultures there are different social role expectations for people of different ages to perform throughout different societies and cultures we view and present the ways social connections and the norms become different in which every society manages people s ageing by allocating certain roles for different age groups age discrimination primarily occurs when age is used as an unfair criterion for allocating more or less resources scholars of age inequality have suggested that certain social organizations favor particular age inequalities for instance because of their emphasis on training and maintaining productive citizens modern capitalist societies may dedicate disproportionate resources to training the young and maintaining the middle aged worker to the detriment of the elderly and the retired especially those already disadvantaged by income wealth inequality in modern technologically advanced societies there is a tendency for both the young and the old to be relatively disadvantaged however more recently in the united states the tendency is for the young to be most disadvantaged for example poverty levels in the u s have been decreasing among people aged 65 and older since the early 1970s whereas the number of children under 18 in poverty has steadily risen sometimes the elderly have had the opportunity to build their wealth throughout their lives while younger people have the disadvantage of recently entering into or having not yet entered into the economic sphere the larger contributor to this however is the increase in the number of people over 65 receiving social security and medicare benefits in the u s the sources of diversity that are produces has effected not only the system in multiple ways but has given the authority to contribute within multiple nations when we compare income distribution among youth across the globe we find that about half 48 5 percent of the world s young people are confined to the bottom two income brackets as of 2007 this means that out of the three billion persons under the age of 24 in the world as of 2007 approximately 1 5 billion were living in situations in which they and their families had access to just nine percent of global income moving up the income distribution ladder children and youth do not fare much better more than two thirds of the world s youth have access to less than 20 percent of global wealth with 86 percent of all young people living on about one third of world income for the just over 400 million youth who are fortunate enough to rank among families or situations at the top of the income distribution however opportunities improve greatly with more than 60 percent of global income as this limits their reaches and their significances although this does not exhaust the scope of age discrimination in modern societies it is often discussed primarily with regards to the work environment indeed non participation in the labour force and the unequal access to rewarding jobs means that the elderly and the young are often subject to unfair disadvantages because of their age on the one hand the elderly are less likely to be involved in the workforce at the same time old age may or may not put one at a disadvantage in accessing positions of prestige old age may benefit one in such positions but it may also disadvantage one because of negative ageist stereotyping of old people on the other hand young people are often disadvantaged from accessing prestigious or relatively rewarding jobs because of their recent entry to the work force or because they are still completing their education typically once they enter the labour force or take a part time job while in school they start at entry level positions with low level wages furthermore because of their lack of prior work experience they can also often be forced to take marginal jobs where they can be taken advantage of by their employers inequalities in health health inequalities can be defined as differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups health care health inequalities are in many cases related to access to health care in industrialized nations health inequalities are most prevalent in countries that have not implemented a universal health care system such as the united states because of the us health care system is heavily privatized access to health care is dependent upon one s economic capital health care is not a right it is a commodity that can be purchased through private insurance companies or that is sometimes provided through an employer the way health care is organized in the u s contributes to health inequalities based on gender socioeconomic status and race ethnicity as wright and perry assert social status differences in health care are a primary mechanism of health inequalities in the united states over 48 million people are without medical care coverage this means that almost one sixth of the population is without health insurance mostly people belonging to the lower classes of society while universal access to health care may not eliminate health inequalities it has been shown that it greatly reduces them in this context privatization gives individuals the power to purchase their own health care through private health insurance companies but this leads to social inequality by only allowing people who have economic resources to access health care citizens are seen as consumers who have a choice to buy the best health care they can afford in alignment with neoliberal ideology this puts the burden on the individual rather than the government or the community in countries that have a universal health care system health inequalities have been reduced in canada for example equity in the availability of health services has been improved dramatically through medicare people don t have to worry about how they will pay health care or rely on emergency rooms for care since health care is provided for the entire population however inequality issues still remain for example not everyone has the same level of access to services inequalities in health are not however only related to access to health care even if everyone had the same level of access inequalities may still remain this is because health status is a product of more than just how much medical care people have available to them while medicare has equalized access to health care by removing the need for direct payments at the time of services which improved the health of low status people inequities in health are still prevalent in canada this may be due to the state of the current social system which bear other types of inequalities such as economic racial and gender inequality a lack of health equity is also evident in the developing world where the importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the millennium development goals health inequalities can vary greatly depending on the country one is looking at health equity is needed in order to live a healthier and more sufficient life within society inequalities in health lead to substantial effects that are burdensome on the entire society inequalities in health are often associated with socioeconomic status and access to health care health inequities can occur when the distribution of public health services is unequal for example in indonesia in 1990 only 12 of government spending for health was for services consumed by the poorest 20 of households while the wealthiest 20 consumed 29 of the government subsidy in the health sector access to health care is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status as well as wealthier population groups have a higher probability of obtaining care when they need it a study by makinen et al 2000 found that in the majority of developing countries they looked at there was an upward trend by quintile in health care use for those reporting illness wealthier groups are also more likely to be seen by doctors and to receive medicine food there has been considerable research in recent years regarding a phenomenon known as food deserts in which low access to fresh healthy food in a neighborhood leads to poor consumer choices and options regarding diet it is widely thought that food deserts are significant contributors to the childhood obesity epidemic in the united states and many other countries this may have significant impacts on the local level as well as in broader contexts such as in greece where the childhood obesity rate has skyrocketed in recent years heavily as a result of the rampant poverty and the resultant lack of access to fresh foods global inequality the economies of the world have developed unevenly historically such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis this was represented by a type of north south divide that existed after world war ii between first world more developed industrialized wealthy countries and third world countries primarily as measured by gdp from around 1980 however through at least 2011 the gdp gap while still wide appeared to be closing and in some more rapidly developing countries life expectancies began to rise however there are numerous limitations of gdp as an economic indicator of social well being if we look at the gini coefficient for world income over time after world war ii the global gini coefficient sat at just under 45 from around 1959 to 1966 the global gini increased sharply to a peak of around 48 in 1966 after falling and leveling off a couple of times during a period from around 1967 to 1984 the gini began to climb again in the mid eighties until reaching a high or around 54 in 2000 then jumped again to around 70 in 2002 since the late 1980s the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed between asia and the advanced economies of the west for example but huge gaps remain globally overall equality across humanity considered as individuals has improved very little within the decade between 2003 and 2013 income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like germany sweden and denmark with a few exceptions france japan spain the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind by 2013 a tiny elite of multibillionaires 85 to be exact had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half 3 5 billion of the world s total population of 7 billion country of citizenship an ascribed status characteristic explains 60 of variability in global income citizenship and parental income class both ascribed status characteristics combined explain more than 80 of income variability inequality and economic growth the concept of economic growth is fundamental in capitalist economies productivity must grow as population grows and capital must grow to feed into increased productivity investment of capital leads to returns on investment roi and increased capital accumulation the hypothesis that economic inequality is a necessary precondition for economic growth has been a mainstay of liberal economic theory recent research particularly over the first two decades of the 21st century has called this basic assumption into question while growing inequality does have a positive correlation with economic growth under specific sets of conditions inequality in general is not positively correlated with economic growth and under some conditions shows a negative correlation with economic growth milanovic 2011 points out that overall global inequality between countries is more important to growth of the world economy than inequality within countries while global economic growth may be a policy priority recent evidence about regional and national inequalities cannot be dismissed when more local economic growth is a policy objective the 2008 financial crisis and following global recession hit countries and shook financial systems all over the world this led to the implementation of large scale fiscal expansionary interventions and as a result to massive public debt issuance in some countries governmental bailouts of the banking system further burdened fiscal balances and raises considerable concern about the fiscal solvency of some countries most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the expansionary measures or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries moreover recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets davtyn et al 2014 studied the interaction of these fiscal conditions and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the uk canada and the us they find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth in the case of the uk but a positive effect in the cases of the us and canada income inequality generally reduces government net lending borrowing for all the countries economic growth they find leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the uk and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the us and canada at the same time economic growth improves government net lending borrowing in all the countries government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the uk but to its increase in the us and canada following the results of alesina and rodrick 1994 bourguignon 2004 and birdsall 2005 show that developing countries with high inequality tend to grow more slowly ortiz and cummings 2011 show that developing countries with high inequality tend to grow more slowly for 131 countries for which they could estimate the change in gini index values between 1990 and 2008 they find that those countries that increased levels of inequality experienced slower annual per capita gdp growth over the same time period noting a lack of data for national wealth they build an index using forbes list of billionaires by country normalized by gdp and validated through correlation with a gini coefficient for wealth and the share of wealth going to the top decile they find that many countries generating low rates of economic growth are also characterized by a high level of wealth inequality with wealth concentration among a class of entrenched elites they conclude that extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth globally regionally and nationally coupled with the negative effects of higher levels of income disparities should make us question current economic development approaches and examine the need to place equity at the center of the development agenda ostry et al 2014 reject the hypothesis that there is a major trade off between a reduction of income inequality through income redistribution and economic growth if that were the case they hold then redistribution that reduces income inequality would on average be bad for growth taking into account both the direct effect of higher redistribution and the effect of the resulting lower inequality their research shows rather the opposite increasing income inequality always has a significant and in most cases negative effect on economic growth while redistribution has an overall pro growth effect in one sample or no growth effect their conclusion is that increasing inequality particularly when inequality is already high results in low growth if any and such growth may be unsustainable over long periods piketty and saez 2014 note that there are important differences between income and wealth inequality dynamics first wealth concentration is always much higher than income concentration the top 10 percent of wealth share typically falls in the 60 to 90 percent range of all wealth whereas the top 10 percent income share is in the 30 to 50 percent range the bottom 50 percent wealth share is always less than 5 percent whereas the bottom 50 percent income share generally falls in the 20 to 30 percent range the bottom half of the population hardly owns any wealth but it does earn appreciable income the inequality of labor income can be high but it is usually much less extreme on average members of the bottom half of the population in terms of wealth own less than one tenth of the average wealth the inequality of labor income can be high but it is usually much less extreme members of the bottom half of the population in income earn about half the average income in sum the concentration of capital ownership is always extreme so that the very notion of capital is fairly abstract for large segments if not the majority of the population piketty 2014 finds that wealth income ratios today seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries similar to what he calls the classic patrimonial wealth based societies of the 19th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living he surmises that wealth accumulation is high because growth is low see also references further reading abel t 2008 cultural capital and social inequality in health journal of epidemiology and community health 62 7 e13 doi 10

"Popular culture": "popular culture also called pop culture or mass culture is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of practices beliefs artistic output also known as popular art cf pop art or mass art sometimes contrasted with fine art and objects that are dominant or prevalent in a society at a given point in time popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects the primary driving forces behind popular culture especially when speaking of western popular cultures are the mass media mass appeal marketing and capitalism and it is produced by what philosopher theodor adorno refers to as the culture industry heavily influenced in modern times by mass media this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of people in a given society therefore popular culture has a way of influencing an individual s attitudes towards certain topics however there are various ways to define pop culture because of this popular culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts it is generally viewed in contrast to other forms of culture such as folk culture working class culture or high culture and also from different academic perspectives such as psychoanalysis structuralism postmodernism and more the common pop culture categories are entertainment such as film music television literature and video games sports news as in people places in the news politics fashion technology and slang history in the past folk culture functioned analogously to the popular culture of the masses and of the nations the phrase popular culture was coined in the 19th century or earlier traditionally popular culture was associated with poor education and with the lower classes as opposed to the official culture and higher education of the upper classes with the rise of the industrial revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates and with the rise of capitalism and industrialization people began to spend more money on entertainment such as commercialised public houses and sports reading also gained traction labeling penny dreadfuls the victorian equivalent of video games the guardian in 2016 described penny fiction as britain s first taste of mass produced popular culture for the young a growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the newly invented railway the first public railway stockton and darlington railway opened in north east england in 1825 created both a market for cheap popular literature and the ability for its distribution on a large scale the first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet the growing demand the stress on the distinction from official culture became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century a usage that became established by the interbellum period from the end of world war ii following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with the connotations of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption the abbreviated form pop for popular as in pop music dates from the late 1950s although the terms pop and popular are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term pop is narrower pop is specific to something containing qualities of mass appeal while popular refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style definition according to author john storey there are various definitions of popular culture the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that too much high culture e g television dramatizations of jane austen is also popular pop culture is also defined as the culture that is leftover when we have decided what high culture is however many works straddle the boundaries e g william shakespeare and charles dickens leo tolstoy and george orwell a third definition equates pop culture with mass culture and ideas this is seen as a commercial culture mass produced for mass consumption by mass media from a western european perspective this may be compared to american culture alternatively pop culture can be defined as an authentic culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the people storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture neo gramscian hegemony theory sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the resistance of subordinate groups in society and the forces of incorporation operating in the interests of dominant groups in society a postmodernist approach to popular culture would no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the industrial revolution studies of shakespeare by weimann barber or bristol for example locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like dario fo and john mcgrath use popular culture in its gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions the commedia dell arte for example popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time it forms currents and eddies and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways for example certain currents of pop culture may originate from or diverge into a subculture representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public important contemporary contributions to understanding what popular culture means have been given by the german researcher ronald daus who studies the impact of extra european cultures in north america asia and especially in latin america levels within the realm of popular culture there exists an organizational culture from its beginning popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push back between them within popular culture there are two levels that have emerged high and low high culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value historically aesthetically and socially low culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes historically folklore adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture this early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media e g in the form of jokes or urban legends with the widespread use of the internet from the 1990s the distinction between mass media and word of mouth has become blurred although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold moreover certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by word of mouth and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves criticism popular culture in the west has been critiqued for being a system of commercialism that privileges products selected and mass marketed by the upper class capitalist elite such criticisms are most notable in many marxist theorists such as herbert marcuse theodor adorno max horkheimer bell hooks antonio gramsci guy debord fredric jameson terry eagleton as well as certain postmodern philosophers such as jean fran\u00e7ois lyotard who has written about the commercialisation of information under capitalism and jean baudrillard as well as others the culture industry the most influential critiques of popular culture came from marxist theorists of the frankfurt school during the twentieth century theodor adorno and max horkheimer analyzed the dangers of the culture industry in their influential work the dialectic of enlightenment by drawing upon the works of kant marx nietzsche and others capitalist popular culture as adorno argued was not an authentic culture of the people but a system of homogenous and standardized products manufactured in the service of capitalist domination by the elite the consumer demand for hollywood films pop tunes and consumable books is influenced by capitalist industries like hollywood and the elite who decide which commodities are to be promoted in the media including television and print journalism adorno wrote the industry bows to the vote it has itself rigged it is the elite who commodify products in accordance with their narrow ideological values and criteria and adorno argues that the audience becomes accustomed to these formulaic conventions making intellectual contemplation impossible adorno s work has had a considerable influence on culture studies philosophy and the new left writing in the new yorker in 2014 music critic alex ross argued that adorno s work has a renewed importance in the digital age the pop hegemony is all but complete its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons culture appears more monolithic than ever with a few gigantic corporations google apple facebook amazon presiding over unprecedented monopolies there is much scholarship on how western entertainment industries strengthen transnational capitalism and reinforce western cultural dominance hence rather than being a local culture commercial entertainment is artificially reinforced by transnational media corporations globalized pop culture can contribute to the homogenization of cultural identities erasing or diluting diverse local traditions and practices in favor of standardized marketable forms of entertainment and consumption jack zipes a professor of german and literature critiqued the mass commercialization and corporate hegemony behind the harry potter franchise he argued that the commodities of the culture industry are popular because they are homogenous and obey standard conventions the media then influences the tastes of children in his analysis of harry potter s global brand zipes wrote it must conform to the standards of exception set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general to be a phenomenon means that a person or commodity must conform to the hegemonic groups that determine what makes up a phenomenon imperialism according to john m mackenzie many products of popular culture have been designed to promote imperialist ideologies and to glorify the british upper classes rather than present a democratic view of the world although there are many films which do not contain such propaganda there have been many films that promote racism and militarist imperialism feminist critique bell hooks an influential feminist argues that commercial commodities and celebrities cannot be symbols of progressiveness when they collaborate with imperialist capitalism and promote ideals of beauty hooks uses beyonc\u00e9 as an example of a commodity reinforced by capitalist corporations complicit in imperialism and patriarchy propaganda edward s herman and noam chomsky critiqued the mass media in their 1988 work manufacturing consent the political economy of the mass media they argue that mass media is controlled by a powerful hegemonic elite who are motivated by their own interests that determine and manipulate what information is present in the mainstream the mass media is therefore a system of propaganda in sum a propaganda approach to media coverage suggests a systematic and highly political dichotomization in news coverage based on serviceability to important domestic power interests this should be observable in dichotomized choices of story and in the volume and quality of coverage such dichotomization in the mass media is massive and systematic not only are choices for publicity and suppression comprehensible in terms of system advantage but the modes of handling favored and inconvenient materials placement tone context fullness of treatment differ in ways that serve political ends consumerism according to the postmodern sociologist jean baudrillard the individual is trained into the duty of seeking the relentless maximization of pleasure lest he or she become asocial therefore enjoyment and fun become indistinguishable from the need to consume whereas the frankfurt school believed consumers were passive baudrillard argued that consumers were trained to consume products in the form of active labor in order to achieve upward social mobility thus consumers under capitalism are trained to purchase products such as pop albums and consumable fiction in order to signal their devotion to social trends fashions and subcultures although the consumption may arise from an active choice the choice is still the consequence of a social conditioning that the individual is unconscious of baudrillard says one is permanently governed by a code whose rules and meaning constraints like those of language are for the most part beyond the grasp of individuals jean baudrillard argued that the vague conception public opinion is a subjective and inaccurate illusion for it attributes a sovereignty to consumers that they do not really have in baudrillard s understanding the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion since they are still produced by a system controlled by the powerful baudrillard stated in an interview critiquing the content and production of the matrix the matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower like we see today and then collaborates in its refraction basically its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself on this point it is worth recalling marshall mcluhan the medium is the message the message of the matrix is its own diffusion by an uncontrollable and proliferating contamination sources print culture with the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century mass produced cheap books pamphlets and periodicals became widely available to the public with this the transmission of common knowledge and ideas was possible radio culture in the 1890s nikola tesla and guglielmo marconi created the radiotelegraph allowing for the modern radio to be born this led to the radio being able to influence a more listened to culture with individuals being able to feel like they have a more direct impact this radio culture is vital because it was imperative to advertising and it introduced the commercial films films and cinema are highly influential to popular culture as films as an art form are what people seem to respond to the most with moving pictures being first captured by eadweard muybridge in 1877 films have evolved into elements that can be cast into different digital formats spreading to different cultures the impact of films and cinema are most evident when analyzing in the search of what the films aim to portray films are used to seek acceptance and understanding of many subjects because of the influence the films carry an example of an early representation of this can be seen in casablanca 1942 the film introduced war subjects to the public after the united states entered world war ii and it meant to increase pro war sentiment for the allies films are a known massive influencer to popular culture yet not all films create a movement that contributes enough to be part of the popular culture that starts movements the content must resonate to most of the public so the knowledge in the material connects with the majority popular culture is a set of beliefs in trends and entail to change a person s set of ideologies and create social transformation the beliefs are still a trend that change more rapidly in the modern age that carries a continuation of outpouring media and more specifically films the trend does not last but it also carries a different effect based on individuals that can be grouped to generalized groups based on age and education the creation of culture by films is seen in fandoms religions ideologies and movements the culture of film is more evident through social media social media is an instant source of feedback and creates discussion on films a repeating event that has been set in modern culture within the trend setting phase is the creation of movements in social media platforms to defend a featured subject on a film popular culture or mass culture is reached easily with films which are easily shared and reached worldwide television programs a television program is a segment of audiovisual content intended for broadcast other than a commercial trailer or other content not serving as attraction for viewership television programs may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or non fictional as in documentary light entertainment news and reality television they may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some made for television movies or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series they can be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows music popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry these forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training it stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music although since the beginning of the recording industry it is also disseminated through recordings traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally or to smaller local audiences sports sports include all forms of competitive physical activity or games which through casual or organized participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and in some cases entertainment for spectators the connection between sports and popular culture is significant in recent times because there is an influx of sport history to keep track of as sports journalists produce quality pieces more sports museums are developed and there are various radio film and television documentaries sport history has embraced popular culture as it has expanded its horizons on elite athletes and governing bodies to the study of every day activities it has broadened its perspective by connecting sports and athletes with class gender ethnicity and disability sports are becoming more popular in the eyes of society and impacting human culture as they get more invested in the game and perhaps even play the sports themselves in their neighborhoods museums also show sports as popular culture such as stuart clarke s the homes of football photographic collection in the national football museum corporate branding corporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity as opposed to specific products or services personal branding personal branding includes the use of social media to promotion to brands and topics to further good repute among professionals in a given field produce an iconic relationship between a professional a brand and its audience that extends networks past the conventional lines established by the mainstream and to enhance personal visibility popular culture is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the practices beliefs and objects that are dominant or prevalent in a society at a given point in time as celebrities online identities are extremely important in order to create a brand to line up sponsorships jobs and opportunities as influencers micro celebrities and users constantly need to find new ways to be unique or stay updated with trends in order to maintain followers views and likes for example ellen degeneres has created her own personal branding through her talk show the ellen degeneres show as she developed her brand we can see the branches she created to extend her fan base such as ellen clothing socks pet beds and more social media social media is interactive computer mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information ideas career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks social media platforms such as instagram facebook twitter youtube pinterest tiktok and snapchat are the most popular applications used on a daily basis by younger generations social media tends to be implemented into the daily routine of individuals in our current society social media is a vital part of our culture as it continues to impact the forms of communication used to connect with those in our communities families or friend groups we often see that terms or slang are used online that is not used in face to face conversations thus adding to a persona users create through the screens of technology for example some individuals respond to situations with a hashtag or emojis social media influencers have become trendsetters through their direct engagement with large audiences upending conventional marketing and advertising techniques consumer purchase choices have been impacted by fashion partnerships sponsored material and outfit ideas offered by influencers social media has also made fashion more accessible by fostering uniqueness expanding the depiction of trends and facilitating the rise of niche influencers the influencer driven fashion industry nevertheless has also come under fire for encouraging excessive consumerism inflated beauty ideals and labour exploitation clothing the fashion industry has witnessed tremendous rapid and applaudable changes over the years culminating in the production of masterpieces unimaginable in the past decades this dynamic trend has compelled renowned clothing lines such as christian dior louis vuitton and balenciaga to intensify research and creative imagination to develop appealing designs that are outstanding and fascinating fashion has changed from the classical baggy and oversized pieces to trendy and slim fit clothes for both males and females fashion trends and what has been considered popular have been directly influenced and affected by the environment and the state of the world dating back to the first and second world wars clothing was designed for functionality as well as to be made in the cheapest way possible this was due to collective preparation efforts through the conservation of materials this trend can also be seen throughout the 1930s or the great depression era of history due to the state of the economy clothing yet again faced fundamental changes in shape and function the term utility clothing was coined meaning that fashion had taken a turn to more reserved silhouettes for efficiency handmade clothing became encouraged through government backed campaigns post war and continuing throughout the 1900s fashion began to take a more individualistic tone primarily marked by the turbulence of the 1960s and momentous social change younger generations started to develop their own sense of style catapulting influences of things like different prints or patterns that can still be seen in the present day the future of fashion is promising and is significantly inspired by past trends despite that influence the fashion industry is moving towards a goal of sustainability this is due to past actions of intense consumerism and fast fashion usage as well as increasing environmental threats the state of the economy continues to have a great effect on fashion as consumers will be looking to make more of an investment in the items that they purchase rather than participating in a constant cycle of buying sustainability is something that designers are actively pursuing as well connolly a british menswear brand is just one example of the many who are challenging designers and stylists to revamp and upcycle pieces of clothing from past collections further the past few decades have seen the reintroduction of old designs which have been revitalized and improvised to fit the current market needs additionally celebrities and influencers are at the forefront of setting fashion trends through various platforms clothing will continue to act as an area for personal expression no matter the trends constantly shaped by the world around us influences pop culture has had a lasting influence to the products being released in their time many examples of art books films and others have been inspired by pop culture these include pop art pop art is an art movement that first emerged in the 1950s as a reaction and a counter to traditional and high class art by including common and well known images and references artists known during this movement include eduardo paolozzi richard hamilton larry rivers robert rauschenberg and andy warhol pop music pop music is a wide ranging genre of music whose characteristics include styles and tones that have a wider and more massive appeal to all kinds of consumers oftentimes many examples of these music contain influences from other pre existing works the origins of popular music began in the late 1800s with the inventions of edison s phonograph and berliner s gramophone both of which allowed for music to be available for purchase to the public rather than access to just the elites due to the almost nonexistent copyright laws the early 1900s flourished with composers and publishers aiming to make and sell as much music as they could the hub for this activity was a small area of new york known as tin pan alley which quickly became one of the major spots for popular music as the demand grew intensely technological advances in the 1940s only furthered the success and popularity of the genre the reel to tape recorder was groundbreaking in terms of innovation and served as the baseline for many more transformations this genre and the music industry as a whole will endure along with the continued innovation of popular music multiple subset genres emerged as the new faces of popular music all with the foundation of jazz and blues some of those genres include rock and roll punk and hip hop due to the increasing mainstream success of popular music artists of the genre grew in fame and popularity a few of the major singers and musicians of this genre include michael jackson madonna britney spears justin bieber

traumatic stress disorder anxiety vs fear anxiety is distinguished from fear which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of fight or flight responses defensive behavior or escape there is a false presumption that often circulates that anxiety only occurs in situations perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable but this is not always so david barlow defines anxiety as a future oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear another description of anxiety is agony dread terror or even apprehension in positive psychology anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills fear and anxiety can be differentiated into four domains 1 duration of emotional experience 2 temporal focus 3 specificity of the threat and 4 motivated direction fear is short lived present focused geared towards a specific threat and facilitating escape from threat on the other hand anxiety is long acting future focused broadly focused towards a diffuse threat and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping joseph e ledoux and lisa feldman barrett have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety symptoms anxiety can be experienced with long drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life known as chronic or generalized anxiety or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic stressful panic attacks known as acute anxiety symptoms of anxiety can range in number intensity and frequency depending on the person however most people do not suffer from chronic anxiety anxiety can induce several psychological pains e g depression or mental disorders and may lead to self harm or suicide the behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns changes in habits increase or decrease in food intake and increased motor tension such as foot tapping the emotional effects of anxiety may include feelings of apprehension or dread trouble concentrating feeling tense or jumpy anticipating the worst irritability restlessness watching for signs of danger and a feeling of empty mindedness as well as nightmares bad dreams obsessions about sensations d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu a trapped in your mind feeling and feeling like everything is scary it may include a vague experience and feeling of helplessness the cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers such as an irrational fear of dying or having a heart attack when in reality all one is experiencing is mild chest pain for example the physiological symptoms of anxiety may include neurological as headache paresthesias fasciculations vertigo or presyncope digestive as abdominal pain nausea diarrhea indigestion dry mouth or bolus stress hormones released in an anxious state have an impact on bowel function and can manifest physical symptoms that may contribute to or exacerbate ibs respiratory as shortness of breath or sighing breathing cardiac as palpitations tachycardia or chest pain muscular as fatigue tremors or tetany cutaneous as perspiration or itchy skin uro genital as frequent urination urinary urgency dyspareunia or impotence chronic pelvic pain syndrome types there are various types of anxiety existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst an existential crisis or nihilistic feelings people can also face mathematical anxiety somatic anxiety stage fright or test anxiety social anxiety refers to a fear of rejection and negative evaluation being judged by other people existential the philosopher s\u00f8ren kierkegaard in the concept of anxiety 1844 described anxiety or dread associated with the dizziness of freedom and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing in art and artist 1932 the psychologist otto rank wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person s simultaneous fear of and desire for separation individuation and differentiation the theologian paul tillich characterized existential anxiety as the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety ontic fate and death moral guilt and condemnation and spiritual emptiness and meaninglessness according to tillich the last of these three types of existential anxiety i e spiritual anxiety is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods tillich argues that this anxiety can be accepted as part of the human condition or it can be resisted but with negative consequences in its pathological form spiritual anxiety may tend to drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by tradition and authority even though such undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of reality according to viktor frankl the author of man s search for meaning when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers the most basic of all human wishes is to find a meaning of life to combat the trauma of nonbeing as death is near depending on the source of the threat psychoanalytic theory distinguishes three types of anxiety realistic neurotic and moral test performance and competitive test according to yerkes dodson law an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam performance or competitive event however when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum the result is a decline in performance test anxiety is the uneasiness apprehension or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following the association of grades with personal worth fear of embarrassment by a teacher fear of alienation from parents or friends time pressures or feeling a loss of control sweating dizziness headaches racing heartbeats nausea fidgeting uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia the dsm iv classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia research indicates that test anxiety among u s high school and college students has been rising since the late 1950s test anxiety remains a challenge for students regardless of age and has considerable physiological and psychological impacts management of test anxiety focuses on achieving relaxation and developing mechanisms to manage anxiety the routine practice of slow device guided breathing dgb is a major component of behavioral treatments for anxiety conditions performance and competitive performance anxiety and competitive anxiety competitive trait anxiety competitive state anxiety happen when an individual s performance is measured against others an important distinction between competitive and non competitive anxiety is that competitive anxiety makes people view their performance as a threat as a result they experience a drop in their ordinary ability whether physical or mental due to that perceived stress competitive anxiety is caused by a range of internal factors including high expectations outside pressure lack of experience and external factors like the location of a competition it commonly occurs in those participating in high pressure activities like sports and debates some common symptoms of competitive anxiety include muscle tension fatigue weakness sense of panic apprehensiveness and panic attacks there are 4 major theories of how anxiety affects performance drive theory inverted u theory reversal theory and the zone of optimal functioning theory drive theory believes that anxiety is positive and performance improves proportionally to the level of anxiety this theory is not well accepted the inverted u theory is based on the idea that performance peaks at a moderate stress level it is called inverted u theory because the graph that plots performance against anxiety looks like an inverted u reversal theory suggests that performance increases in relation to the individual s interpretation of their arousal levels if they believed their physical arousal level would help them their performance would increase if they didn t their performance would decrease for example athletes were shown to worry more when focusing on results and perfection rather than the effort and growth involved the zone of optimal functioning theory proposes that there is a zone where positive and negative emotions are in a balance which lead to feelings of dissociation and intense concentration optimizing the individual s performance levels stranger social and intergroup anxiety humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments anxiety during social interactions particularly between strangers is common among young people it may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia stranger anxiety in small children is not considered a phobia in adults an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage it is called social anxiety according to cutting social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively social anxiety varies in degree and severity for some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact e g embracing shaking hands etc while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether those with this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety minimizing social interaction whenever possible social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders including avoidant personality disorder to the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members or people who share different group memberships i e by race ethnicity class gender etc depending on the nature of the antecedent relations cognitions and situational factors intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety this apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety as is the case with the more generalized forms of social anxiety intergroup anxiety has behavioral cognitive and affective effects for instance increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high indeed such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations i e automatic prejudiced attitudes can be amplified during intergroup interaction negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations but also avoidant or antagonistic behavior such as hostility furthermore when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort e g impression management and self presentation in intragroup contexts levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation trait anxiety can be either a short term state or a long term personality trait trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations whether they are actually deemed threatening or not a meta analysis showed that a high level of neuroticism is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious personality can also be a trait leading to anxiety and depression and their persistence through experience many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature choice or decision anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is recognized as a problem for some individuals and for organizations in 2004 capgemini wrote today we re all faced with greater choice more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice overthinking a choice is called analysis paralysis in a decision context unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision making there are primarily two forms of this anxiety type the first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities the second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities panic disorder panic disorder may share symptoms of stress and anxiety but it is actually very different panic disorder is an anxiety disorder that occurs without any triggers according to the u s department of health and human services this disorder can be distinguished by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear someone with panic disorder will eventually develop constant fear of another attack and as this progresses it will begin to affect daily functioning and an individual s general quality of life it is reported by the cleveland clinic that panic disorder affects 2 to 3 percent of adult americans and can begin around the time of the teenage and early adult years some symptoms include difficulty breathing chest pain dizziness trembling or shaking feeling faint nausea fear that you are losing control or are about to die even though they have these symptoms during an attack the main symptom is the persistent fear of having future panic attacks anxiety disorders anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exaggerated feelings of anxiety and fear responses anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events these feelings may cause physical symptoms such as a fast heart rate and shakiness there are a number of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder specific phobia social anxiety disorder separation anxiety disorder agoraphobia panic disorder and selective mutism the disorder differs by what results in the symptoms people often have more than one anxiety disorder anxiety disorders are caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors to be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present for at least six months be more than would be expected for the situation and decrease a person s ability to function in their daily lives other problems that may result in similar symptoms include hyperthyroidism heart disease caffeine alcohol or cannabis use and withdrawal from certain drugs among others without treatment anxiety disorders tend to remain treatment may include lifestyle changes counselling and medications counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioral therapy medications such as antidepressants or beta blockers may improve symptoms a 2023 review found that regular physical activity is effective for reducing anxiety about 12 of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year and between 12 and 30 are affected at some point in their life they occur about twice as often in women than they do in men and generally begin before the age of 25 the most common anxiety disorders are specific phobias which affect nearly 12 of people and social anxiety disorder which affects 10 of people at some point in their life they affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55 rates appear to be higher in the united states and europe short and long term anxiety anxiety can be either a short term state or a long term trait whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fears four ways to be anxious in his book anxious the modern mind in the age of anxiety joseph ledoux examines four experiences of anxiety through a brain based lens in the presence of an existing or imminent external threat you worry about the event and its implications for your physical and or psychological well being when a threat signal occurs it signifies either that danger is present or near in space and time or that it might be coming in the future nonconscious threats processing by the brain activates defensive survival circuits resulting in changes in information processing in the brain controlled in part by increases in arousal and behavioral and physiological responses in the body that then produce signals that feed back to the brain and complement the physiological changes there intensifying them and extending their duration when you notice body sensations you worry about what they might mean for your physical and or psychological well being the trigger stimulus does not have to be an external stimulus but can be an internal one as some people are particularly sensitive to body signals thoughts and memories may lead to you to worry about your physical and or psychological well being we do not need to be in the presence of an external or internal stimulus to be anxious an episodic memory of a past trauma or of a panic attack in the past is sufficient to activate the defence circuits thoughts and memories may result in existential dread such as worry about leading a meaningful life or the eventuality of death examples are contemplations of whether one s life has been meaningful the inevitability of death or the difficulty of making decisions that have a moral value these do not necessarily activate defensive systems they are more or less pure forms of cognitive anxiety co morbidity anxiety disorders often occur with other mental health disorders particularly major depressive disorder bipolar disorder eating disorders or certain personality disorders it also commonly occurs with personality traits such as neuroticism this observed co occurrence is partly due to genetic and environmental influences shared between these traits and anxiety it is common for those with obsessive compulsive disorder to experience anxiety anxiety is also commonly found in those who experience panic disorders phobic anxiety disorders severe stress dissociative disorders somatoform disorders and some neurotic disorders anxiety has also been linked to the experience of intrusive thoughts studies have revealed that individuals who experience high levels of anxiety also known as clinical anxiety are highly vulnerable to the experience of intense intrusive thoughts or psychological disorders that are characterised by intrusive thoughts risk factors anxiety disorders are partly genetic with twin studies suggesting 30 40 genetic influence on individual differences in anxiety environmental factors are also important twin studies show that individual specific environments have a large influence on anxiety whereas shared environmental influences environments that affect twins in the same way operate during childhood but decline through adolescence specific measured environments that have been associated with anxiety include child abuse family history of mental health disorders and poverty anxiety is also associated with drug use including alcohol and caffeine as well as benzodiazepines which are often prescribed to treat anxiety genetics genetics and family history e g parental anxiety may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation estimates of genetic influence on anxiety based on studies of twins range from 25 to 40 depending on the specific type and age group under study for example genetic differences account for about 43 of variance in panic disorder and 28 in generalized anxiety disorder longitudinal twin studies have shown the moderate stability of anxiety from childhood through to adulthood is mainly influenced by stability in genetic influence when investigating how anxiety is passed on from parents to children it is important to account for sharing of genes as well as environments for example using the intergenerational children of twins design many studies in the past used a candidate gene approach to test whether single genes were associated with anxiety these investigations were based on hypotheses about how certain known genes influence neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine and hormones such as cortisol that are implicated in anxiety none of these findings are well replicated with the possible exception of tmem132d comt and mao a the epigenetic signature of bdnf a gene that codes for a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor that is found in the brain has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity and a receptor gene for bdnf called ntrk2 was associated with anxiety in a large genome wide investigation the reason that most candidate gene findings have not replicated is that anxiety is a complex trait that is influenced by many genomic variants each of which has a small effect on its own increasingly studies of anxiety are using a hypothesis free approach to look for parts of the genome that are implicated in anxiety using big enough samples to find associations with variants that have small effects the largest explorations of the common genetic architecture of anxiety have been facilitated by the uk biobank the angst consortium and the crc fear anxiety and anxiety disorders epigenetics medical conditions many medical conditions can cause anxiety this includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe like copd and asthma and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety the same is true for some sexual dysfunctions conditions that affect the face or the skin can cause social anxiety especially among adolescents and developmental disabilities often lead to social anxiety for children as well life threatening conditions like cancer also cause anxiety furthermore certain organic diseases may present with anxiety or symptoms that mimic anxiety these disorders include certain endocrine diseases hypo and hyperthyroidism hyperprolactinemia metabolic disorders diabetes deficiency states low levels of vitamin d b2 b12 folic acid gastrointestinal diseases celiac disease non celiac gluten sensitivity inflammatory bowel disease heart diseases blood diseases anemia cerebral vascular accidents transient ischemic attack stroke and brain degenerative diseases parkinson s disease dementia multiple sclerosis huntington s disease among others substance induced several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety whether in intoxication withdrawal or as side effect these include alcohol tobacco sedatives including prescription benzodiazepines opioids including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin stimulants such as caffeine cocaine and amphetamines hallucinogens and inhalants while many often report self medicating anxiety with these substances improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short lived with worsening of anxiety in the long term sometimes with acute anxiety as soon as the drug effects wear off and tend to be exaggerated acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria anxiety and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure psychological poor coping skills e g rigidity inflexible problem solving denial avoidance impulsivity extreme self expectation negative thoughts affective instability and inability to focus on problems are associated with anxiety anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person s own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity temperament e g neuroticism and attitudes e g pessimism have been found to be risk factors for anxiety cognitive distortions such as overgeneralizing catastrophizing mind reading emotional reasoning binocular trick and mental filter can result in anxiety for example an overgeneralized belief that something bad always happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment in addition those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events together these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well as stressful events which in turn cause more anxiety such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with cognitive therapy psychodynamic theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing unconscious wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive defense mechanisms such as suppression repression anticipation regression somatization passive aggression dissociation that develop to adapt to problems with early objects e g caregivers and empathic failures in childhood for example persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress somatization when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individual s awareness such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with psychodynamic therapy while psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors evolutionary psychology an evolutionary psychology explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased vigilance regarding potential threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats this may cause false positive reactions but an individual with anxiety may also avoid real threats this may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents there is ample empirical evidence that anxiety can have adaptive value within a school timid fish are more likely than bold fish to survive a predator when people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes pet scans show increased blood flow in the amygdala in these studies the participants also reported moderate anxiety this might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors social social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma e g physical sexual or emotional abuse or assault bullying early life experiences and parenting factors e g rejection lack of warmth high hostility harsh discipline high parental negative affect anxious childrearing modelling of dysfunctional and drug abusing behaviour discouragement of emotions poor socialization poor attachment and child abuse and neglect cultural factors e g stoic families cultures persecuted minorities including those with disabilities and socioeconomics e g uneducated unemployed impoverished although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries a 2019 comprehensive systematic review of over 50 studies showed that food insecurity in the united states is strongly associated with depression anxiety and sleep disorders food insecure individuals had an almost 3 fold risk increase of testing positive for anxiety when compared to food secure individuals gender socialization contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences in particular learning mastery the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control and instrumentality which includes such traits as self confidence self efficacy independence and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety that is though gender differences in anxiety exist with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences treatment the first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause the recognition of which is essential in order to decide the correct treatment anxiety symptoms may mask an organic disease or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder cognitive behavioral therapy cbt is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment cbt appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet while evidence for mental health apps is promising it is preliminary anxiety often affects relationships and interpersonal psychotherapy addresses these issues by improving communication and relationship skills psychopharmacological treatment can be used in parallel to cbt or can be used alone as a general rule most anxiety disorders respond well to first line agents such drugs also used as anti depressants are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that work by blocking the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters and resulting in the increase in availability of these neurotransmitters additionally benzodiazepines are often prescribed to individuals with anxiety disorder benzodiazepines produce an anxiolytic response by modulating gaba and increasing its receptor binding a third common treatment involves a category of drug known as serotonin agonists this category of drug works by initiating a physiological response at 5 ht1a receptor by increasing the action of serotonin at this receptor other treatment options include pregabalin tricyclic antidepressants and moclobemide among others anxiety is considered to be a serious psychiatric illness that has an unknown true pervasiveness due to affected individuals not asking for proper treatment or aid and due to professionals missing the diagnosis prevention the above risk factors give natural avenues for prevention psychological or educational interventions have a small yet statistically significant benefit for the prevention of anxiety in varied population types improvement in dietary intake and habits may also help lower the risk of anxiety see also list of people with an anxiety disorder angst intense feeling of apprehension anxiety or inner turmoil

mental stress induced myocardial ischemia references", "Depression (mood)": "depression is a mental state of low mood and aversion to activity it affects about 3 5 of the global population or about 280 million people worldwide as of 2020 depression affects a person s thoughts behavior feelings and sense of well being the pleasure or joy that a person gets from certain experiences is reduced and the afflicted person often experiences a loss of motivation or interest in those activities people with depression may experience sadness feelings of dejection or hopelessness difficulty in thinking and concentration or a significant change in appetite or time spent sleeping suicidal thoughts can also be experienced depression can have multiple sometimes overlapping origins depression can be a symptom of some mood disorders some of which are also commonly called depression such as major depressive disorder bipolar disorder and dysthymia additionally depression can be a normal temporary reaction to life events such as the loss of a loved one depression is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments contributing factors life events adversity in childhood such as bereavement neglect mental abuse physical abuse sexual abuse or unequal parental treatment of siblings can contribute to depression in adulthood childhood physical or sexual abuse in particular significantly correlates with the likelihood of experiencing depression over the survivor s lifetime people who have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences are 3 2 to 4 0 times more likely to suffer from depression poor housing quality non functionality lack of green spaces and exposure to noise and air pollution are linked to depressive moods emphasizing the need for consideration in planning to prevent such outcomes locality has also been linked to depression and other negative moods the rate of depression among those who reside in large urban areas is shown to be lower than those who do not likewise those from smaller towns and rural areas tend to have higher rates of depression anxiety and psychological unwellness studies have consistently shown that physicians have had the highest depression and suicide rates compared to people in many other lines of work for suicide 40 higher for male physicians and 130 higher for female physicians life events and changes that may cause depressed mood includes but are not limited to childbirth menopause financial difficulties unemployment stress such as from work education military service family living conditions marriage etc a medical diagnosis cancer hiv diabetes etc bullying loss of a loved one natural disasters social isolation rape relationship troubles jealousy separation or catastrophic injury similar depressive symptoms are associated with survivor s guilt adolescents may be especially prone to experiencing a depressed mood following social rejection peer pressure or bullying childhood and adolescence depression in childhood and adolescence is similar to adult major depressive disorder although young sufferers may exhibit increased irritability or behavioral dyscontrol instead of the more common sad empty or hopeless feelings seen with adults children who are under stress experiencing loss or have other underlying disorders are at a higher risk for depression childhood depression is often comorbid with mental disorders outside of other mood disorders most commonly anxiety disorder and conduct disorder depression also tends to run in families personality depression is associated with low extraversion and people who have high levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience depressive symptoms and are more likely to receive a diagnosis of a depressive disorder additionally depression is associated with low conscientiousness some factors that may arise from low conscientiousness include disorganization and dissatisfaction with life individuals may be more exposed to stress and depression as a result of these factors side effect of medical treatment it is possible that some early generation beta blockers induce depression in some patients though the evidence for this is weak and conflicting there is strong evidence for a link between alpha interferon therapy and depression one study found that a third of alpha interferon treated patients had developed depression after three months of treatment beta interferon therapy appears to have no effect on rates of depression there is moderately strong evidence that finasteride when used in the treatment of alopecia increases depressive symptoms in some patients evidence linking isotretinoin an acne treatment to depression is strong other medicines that seem to increase the risk of depression include anticonvulsants antimigraine drugs antipsychotics and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist substance induced several drugs of abuse can cause or exacerbate depression whether in intoxication withdrawal and from chronic use these include alcohol sedatives including prescription benzodiazepines opioids including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs such as heroin stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines hallucinogens and inhalants non psychiatric illnesses depressed mood can be the result of a number of infectious diseases nutritional deficiencies neurological conditions and physiological problems including hypoandrogenism in men addison s disease cushing s syndrome pernicious anemia hypothyroidism hyperparathyroidism lyme disease multiple sclerosis parkinson s disease celiac disease chronic pain stroke diabetes cancer and hiv studies have found that anywhere from 30 to 85 percent of patients suffering from chronic pain are also clinically depressed a 2014 study by hooley et al concluded that chronic pain increased the chance of death by suicide by two to three times in 2017 the british medical association found that 49 of uk chronic pain patients also had depression as many as 1 3 of stroke survivors will later develop post stroke depression because strokes may cause damage to the parts of the brain involved in processing emotions reward and cognition stroke may be considered a direct cause of depression psychiatric syndromes a number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom the mood disorders are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood these include major depressive disorder commonly called major depression or clinical depression where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities and dysthymia a state of chronic depressed mood the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a major depressive episode another mood disorder bipolar disorder features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood cognition and energy levels but may also involve one or more episodes of depression individuals with bipolar depression are often misdiagnosed with unipolar depression when the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern the disorder major depressive disorder bipolar disorder etc may be described as a seasonal affective disorder outside the mood disorders borderline personality disorder often features an extremely intense depressive mood adjustment disorder with depressed mood is a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode and posttraumatic stress disorder a mental disorder that sometimes follows trauma is commonly accompanied by depressed mood inflammation historical legacy research suggests possible associations between neanderthal genetics and some forms of depression authors and researchers have begun to conceptualize ways in which the historical legacies of racism and colonialism may create depressive conditions given the lived experiences of marginalized peoples ranging from conditions of migration class stratification cultural genocide labor exploitation and social immobility depression can be seen as a rational response to global conditions according to ann cvetkovich psychogeographical depression overlaps somewhat with the theory of deprejudice a portmanteau of depression and prejudice proposed by cox abramson devine and hollon in 2012 who argue for an integrative approach to studying the often comorbid experiences cox abramson devine and hollon are concerned with the ways in which social stereotypes are often internalized creating negative self stereotypes that then produce depressive symptoms unlike the theory of deprejudice a psychogeographical theory of depression attempts to broaden study of the subject beyond an individual experience to one produced on a societal scale seeing particular manifestations of depression as rooted in dispossession historical legacies of genocide slavery and colonialism are productive of segregation both material and psychic material deprivation and concomitant circumstances of violence systemic exclusion and lack of access to legal protections the demands of navigating these circumstances compromise the resources available to a population to seek comfort health stability and sense of security the historical memory of this trauma conditions the psychological health of future generations making psychogeographical depression an intergenerational experience as well this work is supported by recent studies in genetic science which has demonstrated an epigenetic link between the trauma suffered by holocaust survivors and genetic reverberations in subsequent generations measures measures of depression include but are not limited to beck depression inventory 11 and the 9 item depression scale in the patient health questionnaire phq 9 both of these measures are psychological tests that ask personal questions of the participant and have mostly been used to measure the severity of depression the beck depression inventory is a self report scale that helps a therapist identify the patterns of depression symptoms and monitor recovery the responses on this scale can be discussed in therapy to devise interventions for the most distressing symptoms of depression theories there are multiple schools of depression theory beck s cognitive triad theorizes that an individual with depression has automatic spontaneous and seemingly uncontrollable negative thoughts about the self the world or environment and the future the tripartite model of anxiety and depression helps to explain the common comorbidity of anxiety and depression by separating symptoms into three groups negative affect positive affect and physiological hyperarousal the epigenetics of depression is the study of how epigenetics heritable characteristics that do not involve changes in dna sequence contribute to depression behavioral theories of depression explain the etiology of depression with behavioral science adherents promote the use of behavioral therapies for treatment evolutionary approaches to depression are attempts by evolutionary psychologists and evolutionary psychiatrists to use the theory of evolution to further understand mood disorders the biology of depression is the attempt to identify a biochemical origin of depression as opposed to theories that emphasize psychological or situational causes management depressed mood may not require professional treatment and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events a symptom of some medical condition or a side effect of some drugs or medical treatments a prolonged depressed mood especially in combination with other symptoms may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment the uk national institute for health and care excellence nice 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the risk benefit ratio is poor physical activity has a protective effect against the emergence of depression in some people increased daily step counts have been associated with lower depressive symptoms there is limited evidence suggesting yoga may help some people with depressive disorders or elevated levels of depression but more research is needed reminiscence of old and fond memories is another alternative form of treatment especially for the elderly who have lived longer and have more experiences in life it is a method that causes a person to recollect memories of their own life leading to a process of self recognition and identifying familiar stimuli by maintaining one s personal past and identity it is a technique that stimulates people to view their lives in a more objective and balanced way causing them to pay attention to positive information in their life stories which would successfully reduce depressive mood levels there is limited evidence that continuing antidepressant medication for one year reduces the risk of depression recurrence with no additional harm recommendations for psychological treatments or combination treatments in preventing recurrence are not clear epidemiology depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide the united nations un health agency reported estimating that it affects more than 300 million people worldwide the majority of them women young people and the elderly an estimated 4 4 percent of the global population has depression according to a report released by the un world health organization who which shows an 18 percent increase in the number of people living with depression between 2005 and 2015 depression is a major mental health cause of disease burden its consequences further lead to significant burden in public health including a higher risk of dementia premature mortality arising from physical disorders and maternal depression impacts on child growth and development approximately 76 to 85 of depressed people in low and middle income countries do not receive treatment barriers to treatment include inaccurate assessment lack of trained health care providers social stigma and lack of resources the stigma comes from misguided societal views that people with mental illness are different from everyone else and they can choose to get better only if they wanted to due to this more than half of the people with depression do not receive help with their disorders the stigma leads to a strong preference for privacy an analysis of 40 350 undergraduates from 70 institutions by posselt and lipson found that undergraduates who perceived their classroom environments as highly competitive had a 37 higher chance of developing depression and a 69 higher chance of developing anxiety several studies have suggested that unemployment roughly doubles the risk of developing depression the world health organization has constructed guidelines known as the mental health gap action programme mhgap aiming to increase services for people with mental neurological and substance use disorders depression is listed as one of conditions prioritized by the programme trials conducted show possibilities for the implementation of the programme in low resource primary care settings dependent on primary care practitioners and lay health workers examples of mhgap endorsed therapies targeting depression include group interpersonal therapy as group treatment for depression and thinking health which utilizes cognitive behavioral therapy to tackle perinatal depression furthermore effective screening in primary care is crucial for the access of treatments the mhgap adopted its approach of improving detection rates of depression by training general practitioners however there is still weak evidence supporting this training according to 2011 study people who are high in hypercompetitive traits are also likely to measure higher for depression and anxiety history the term depression was derived from the latin verb deprimere to press down from the 14th century to depress meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits it was used in 1665 in english author richard baker s chronicle to refer to someone having a great depression of spirit and by english author samuel johnson in a similar sense in 1753 in ancient greece disease was thought due to an imbalance in the four basic bodily fluids or humors personality types were similarly thought to be determined by the dominant humor in a particular person derived from the ancient greek melas black and khol\u00e9 bile melancholia was described as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms by hippocrates in his aphorisms where he characterized all fears and despondencies if they last a long time as being symptomatic of the ailment during the 18th century the humoral theory of melancholia was increasingly being challenged by mechanical and electrical explanations references to dark and gloomy states gave way to ideas of slowed circulation and depleted energy german physician johann christian heinroth however argued melancholia was a disturbance of the soul due to moral conflict within the patient in the 20th century the german psychiatrist emil kraepelin distinguished manic depression the influential system put forward by kraepelin unified nearly all types of mood disorder into manic depressive insanity kraepelin worked from an assumption of underlying brain pathology but also promoted a distinction between endogenous internally caused and exogenous externally caused types other psycho dynamic theories were proposed existential and humanistic theories represented a forceful affirmation of individualism austrian existential psychiatrist viktor frankl connected depression to feelings of futility and meaninglessness frankl s logotherapy addressed the filling of an existential vacuum associated with such feelings and may be particularly useful for depressed adolescents researchers theorized that depression was caused by a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of reserpine and isoniazid in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms during the 1960s and 70s manic depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder now most commonly known as bipolar disorder which was distinguished from unipolar depression the terms unipolar and bipolar had been coined by german psychiatrist karl kleist in july 2022 british psychiatrist joanna moncrieff also psychiatrist mark horowtiz and others proposed in a study on academic journal molecular psychiatry that depression is not caused by a serotonin imbalance in the human body unlike what most of the psychiatry community points to and that therefore anti depressants do not work against the illness however such study was met with criticism from some psychiatrists who argued the study s methodology used an indirect trace of serotonin instead of taking direct measurements of the molecule moncrieff said that despite her study s conclusions no one should interrupt their treatment if they are taking any anti depressant see also alain

theological views of georg hermes the starting point and chief principle of every science and hence of theology also is not only methodical doubt but positive doubt one can believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds and consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason doubt that god s exist may form the basis of agnosticism the belief that one cannot determine the existence or non existence of god s it may also form other brands of skepticism such as pyrrhonism which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god s but remain negative alternatively doubt over the existence of god s may lead to acceptance of a particular religion compare pascal s wager doubt of a specific theology scriptural or deistic may bring into question the truth of that theology s set of beliefs on the other hand doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of heresy and or the splitting off of sects or groups of thought thus proto protestants doubted papal authority and substituted alternative methods of governance in their new but still recognizably similar churches christian existentialists such as s\u00f8ren kierkegaard suggest that for one to truly have belief in god one would also have to doubt one s beliefs about god the doubt is the rational part of a person s thought involved in weighing evidence without which the belief would have no real substance belief is not a decision based on evidence that say certain beliefs about god are true or a certain person is worthy of love no such evidence could ever be enough to pragmatically justify the kind of total commitment involved in true theological belief or romantic love belief involves making that commitment anyway kierkegaard thought that to have belief is at the same time to have doubt law most criminal cases within an adversarial system require that the prosecution proves its contentions beyond a reasonable doubt a doctrine also called the burden of proof this means that the state must present propositions which preclude reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable person as to the guilt of defendant some doubt may persist but only to the extent that it would not affect a reasonable person s belief in the defendant s guilt if the doubt raised does affect a reasonable person s belief the jury is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the jurisprudence of the applicable jurisdiction usually defines the precise meaning of words such as reasonable

about one s personal identity they are accompanied by anxiety and stress often to such a degree that they disturb one s normal functioning in everyday life and lead to depression their negative attitude towards meaning reflects characteristics of the philosophical movement of existentialism the components of existential crises can be divided into emotional cognitive and behavioral aspects emotional components refer to the feelings such as emotional pain despair helplessness guilt anxiety or loneliness cognitive components encompass the problem of meaninglessness the loss of personal values or spiritual faith and thinking about death behavioral components include addictions and anti social and compulsive behavior existential crises may occur at different stages in life the teenage crisis the quarter life crisis the mid life crisis and the later life crisis earlier crises tend to be forward looking the individual is anxious and confused about which path in life to follow regarding education career personal identity and social relationships later crises tend to be backward looking often triggered by the impression that one is past one s peak in life they are usually characterized by guilt regret and a fear of death if an earlier existential crisis was properly resolved it is easier for the individual to resolve or avoid later crises not everyone experiences existential crises in their life the problem of meaninglessness plays a central role in all of these types it can arise in the form of cosmic meaning which is concerned with the meaning of life at large or why we are here another form concerns personal secular meaning in which the individual tries to discover purpose and value mainly for their own life finding a source of meaning may resolve a crisis like altruism dedicating oneself to a religious or political cause or finding a way to develop one s potential other approaches include adopting a new system of meaning learning to accept meaninglessness cognitive behavioral therapy and the practice of social perspective taking negative consequences of existential crisis include anxiety and bad relationships on the personal level as well as a high divorce rate and decreased productivity on the social level some questionnaires such as the purpose in life test measure whether someone is currently undergoing an existential crisis outside its main use in psychology and psychotherapy the term existential crisis refers to a threat to the existence of something definition in psychology and psychotherapy the term existential crisis refers to a form of inner conflict it is characterized by the impression that life lacks meaning and is accompanied by various negative experiences such as stress anxiety despair and depression this often happens to such a degree that it disturbs one s normal functioning in everyday life the inner nature of this conflict sets existential crises apart from other types of crises that are mainly due to outward circumstances like social or financial crises outward circumstances may still play a role in triggering or exacerbating an existential crisis but the core conflict happens on an inner level the most common approach to resolving an existential crisis consists in addressing this inner conflict and finding new sources of meaning in life the core issue responsible for the inner conflict is the impression that the individual s desire to lead a meaningful life is thwarted by an apparent lack of meaning also because they feel much confusion about what meaning really is and are constantly questioning themselves in this sense existential crises are crises of meaning this is often understood through the lens of the philosophical movement known as existentialism one important aspect of many forms of existentialism is that the individual seeks to live in a meaningful way but finds themselves in a meaningless and indifferent world the exact term existential crisis is not commonly found in the traditional existentialist literature in philosophy but various closely related technical terms are discussed such as existential dread existential vacuum existential despair existential neurosis existential sickness anxiety and alienation different authors focus in their definitions of existential crisis on different aspects some argue that existential crises are at their core crises of identity on this view they arise from a confusion about the question who am i and their goal is to achieve some form of clarity about oneself and one s position in the world as identity crises they involve intensive self analysis often in the form of exploring different ways of looking at oneself they constitute a personal confrontation with certain key aspects of the human condition like existence death freedom and responsibility in this sense the person questions the very foundations of their life others emphasize the confrontation with human limitations such as death and lack of control some stress the spiritual nature of existential crises by pointing out how outwardly successful people may still be severely affected by them if they lack the corresponding spiritual development the term existential crisis is most commonly used in the context of psychology and psychotherapy but it can also be employed in a more literal sense as a crisis of existence to express that the existence of something is threatened in this sense a country a company or a social institution faces an existential crisis if political tensions military threats high debt or social changes may have as a result that the corresponding entity ceases to exist components existential crises are usually seen as complex phenomena that can be understood as consisting of various components some approaches distinguish three types of components belonging to the fields of emotion cognition and behavior emotional aspects correspond to what it feels like to have an existential crisis it is usually associated with emotional pain despair helplessness guilt anxiety and loneliness on the cognitive side the affected are often confronted with a loss of meaning and purpose together with the realization of one s own end behaviorally existential crises may express themselves in addictions and anti social behavior sometimes paired with ritualistic behavior loss of relationships and degradation of one s health while manifestations of these three components can usually be identified in every case of an existential crisis there are often significant differences in how they manifest nonetheless it has been suggested that these components can be used to give a more unified definition of existential crises emotional on the emotional level existential crises are associated with unpleasant experiences such as fear anxiety panic and despair they can be categorized as a form of emotional pain whereby people lose trust and hope this pain often manifests in the form of despair and helplessness the despair may be caused by being unable to find meaning in life which is associated both with a lack of motivation and the absence of inner joy the impression of helplessness arises from being unable to find a practical response to deal with the crisis and the associated despair this helplessness concerns specifically a form of emotional vulnerability the individual is not just subject to a wide range of negative emotions but these emotions often seem to be outside the person s control this feeling of vulnerability and lack of control can itself produce further negative impressions and may lead to a form of panic or a state of deep mourning but on the other hand there is also often an impression in the affected that they are in some sense responsible for their predicament this is the case for example if the loss of meaning is associated with bad choices in the past for which the individual feels guilty but it can also take the form of a more abstract type of bad conscience as existential guilt in this case the agent carries a vague sense of guilt that is free floating in the sense that it is not tied to any specific wrongdoing by the agent especially in existential crises in the later parts of one s life this guilt is often accompanied by a fear of death but just as in the case of guilt this fear may also take a more abstract form as an unspecific anxiety associated with a sense of deficiency and meaninglessness as crises of identity existential crises often lead to a disturbed sense of personal integrity this can be provoked by the apparent meaninglessness of one s life together with a general lack of motivation central to the sense of personal integrity are close relationships with oneself others and the world the absence of meaning usually has a negative impact on these relationships as a lack of a clear purpose it threatens one s personal integrity and can lead to insecurity alienation and self abandonment the negative impact on one s relationships with others is often experienced as a form of loneliness depending on the person and the crisis they are suffering some of these emotional aspects may be more or less pronounced while they are all experienced as unpleasant they often carry within them various positive potentials as well that can push the person in the direction of positive personal development through the experience of loneliness for example the person may achieve a better understanding of the substance and importance of relationships cognitive the main cognitive aspect of existential crises is the loss of meaning and purpose in this context the term meaninglessness refers to the general impression that there is no higher significance direction or purpose in our actions or in the world at large it is associated with the question of why one is doing what one is doing and why one should continue it is a central topic in existentialist psychotherapy which has as one of its main goals to help the patient find a proper response to this meaninglessness in viktor frankl s logotherapy for example the term existential vacuum is used to describe this state of mind many forms of existentialist psychotherapy aim to resolve existential crises by assisting the patient in rediscovering meaning in their life closely related to meaninglessness is the loss of personal values this means that things that seemed valuable to the individual before like the relation to a specific person or success in their career may now appear insignificant or pointless to them if the crisis is resolved it can lead to the discovery of new values another aspect of the cognitive component of many existential crises concerns the attitude to one s personal end i e the realization that one will die one day while this is not new information as an abstract insight it takes on a more personal and concrete nature when one sees oneself confronted with this fact as a concrete reality one has to face this aspect is of particular relevance for existential crises occurring later in life or when the crisis was triggered by the loss of a loved one or by the onset of a terminal disease for many the issue of their own death is associated with anxiety but it has also been argued that the contemplation of one s death may act as a key to resolving an existential crisis the reason for this is that the realization that one s time is limited can act as a source of meaning by making the remaining time more valuable and by making it easier to discern the bigger issues that matter in contrast to smaller everyday issues that can act as distractions important factors for dealing with imminent death include one s religious outlook one s self esteem and social integration as well as one s future prospects behavioral existential crises can have various effects on the individual s behavior they often lead a person to isolate themself and engage less in social interactions for example one s communication to one s housemates may be limited to very brief responses like a simple yes or no in order to avoid a more extended exchange or the individual reduces various forms of contact that are not strictly speaking necessary this can result in a long term deterioration and loss of one s relationships in some cases existential crises may also express themselves in overtly anti social behavior like hostility or aggression these negative impulses can also be directed at the person themselves leading to self injury and in the worst case suicide addictive behavior is also seen in people going through an existential crisis some turn to drugs in order to lessen the impact of the negative experiences whereas others hope to learn through the non ordinary drug experiences to cope with the existential crisis while this type of behavior can succeed in providing a short term relief of the effects of the existential crisis it has been argued that it is usually maladaptive and fails on the long term level this way the crises may even be further exacerbated for the affected it is often difficult to distinguish the need for pleasure and power from the need for meaning thereby leading them on a wrong track in their efforts to resolve the crisis the addictions themselves or the stress associated with existential crises can result in various health problems ranging from high blood pressure to long term organ damage and increased likelihood of cancer existential crises may also be accompanied by ritualistic behavior in some cases this can have positive effects to help the affected transition to a new outlook on life but it might also take the form of compulsive behavior that acts more as a distraction than as a step towards a solution another positive behavioral aspect concerns the tendency to seek therapy this tendency reflects the awareness of the affected of the gravity of the problem and their desire to resolve it types different types of existential crises are often distinguished based on the time in one s life when they occur this approach rests on the idea that depending on one s stage in life individuals are faced with different issues connected to meaning and purpose they lead to different types of crises if these issues are not properly resolved the stages are usually tied to rough age groups but this correspondence is not always accurate since different people of the same age group may find themselves in different life situations and different stages of development being aware of these differences is central for properly assessing the issue at the core of a specific crisis and finding a corresponding response to resolve it the most well known existential crisis is the mid life crisis and a lot of research is directed specifically at this type of crisis but researchers have additionally discovered various other existential crises belonging to different types there is no general agreement about their exact number and periodization because of this the categorizations of different theorists do not always coincide but they have significant overlaps one categorization distinguishes between the early teenage crisis the sophomore crisis the adult crisis the mid life crisis and the later life crisis another focuses only on the sophomore crisis the adult crisis and the later life crisis but defines them in wider terms the sophomore crisis and the adult crisis are often treated together as forms of the quarter life crisis there is wide agreement that the earlier crises tend to be more forward looking and are characterized by anxiety and confusion about the path in life one wants to follow the later crises on the other hand are more backward looking often in the form of guilt and regrets while also concerned with the problem of one s own mortality these different crises can affect each other in various ways for example if an earlier crisis was not properly resolved later crises may impose additional difficulties for the affected but even if an earlier crisis was fully resolved this does not guarantee that later crises will be successfully resolved or avoided altogether another approach distinguishes existential crises based on their intensity some theorists use the terms existential vacuum and existential neurosis to refer to different degrees of existential crisis on this view an existential vacuum is a rather common phenomenon characterized by the frequent recurrence of subjective states like boredom apathy and emptiness some people experience this only in their free time but are otherwise not troubled by it the term sunday neurosis is often used in this context an existential vacuum becomes an existential neurosis if it is paired with overt clinical neurotic symptoms such as depression or alcoholism teenage the early teenage crisis involves the transition from childhood to adulthood and is centered around the issue of developing one s individuality and independence this concerns specifically the relation to one s family and often leads to spending more time with one s peers instead various rebellious and anti social behavior seen sometimes in this developmental stage like stealing or trespassing may be interpreted as attempts to achieve independence it can also give rise to a new type of conformity concerning for example how the teenager dresses or behaves this conformity tends to be not in relation to one s family or public standards but to one s peer group or adored celebrities but this may be seen as a temporary step in order to distance oneself from previously accepted standards with later steps emphasizing one s independence also from one s peer group and celebrity influences a central factor for resolving the early teenage crisis is that meaning and purpose are found in one s new identity since independence without it can result in the feeling of being lost and may lead to depression another factor pertains to the role of the parents by looking for signs of depression they may become aware that a teenager is going through a crisis examples include a change of appetite sleep behavior is different sleeps more or less grades take a dive in a short amount of time they are less social and more isolated and start to become easily irritated if parents regularly talk to their teenagers and ask them questions it is more likely that they detect the presence of a crisis quarter life sophomore and adult the term quarter life crisis is often used to refer to existential crises occurring in early adulthood i e roughly during the ages between 18 and 30 some authors distinguish between two separate crises that may occur at this stage in life the sophomore crisis and the adult crisis the sophomore crisis affects primarily people in their late teenage years or their early 20s it is also referred to as sophomore slump specifically when it affects students it is the first time that serious questions about the meaning of life and one s role in the world are formulated at this stage these questions have a direct practical relation to one s future they apply to what paths one wants to choose in life like which career to focus on and how to form successful relationships at the center of the sophomore crisis is the anxiety over one s future i e how to lead one s life and how to best develop and employ one s abilities existential crisis often specifically affect high achievers who fear that they do not reach their highest potential since they lack a secure plan for the future to solve them it is necessary to find meaningful answers to these questions such answers may result in practical commitments and can inform later life decisions some people who have already made their career choices at a very early age may never experience a sophomore crisis but such decisions can lead to problems later on since they are usually mainly informed by the outlook of one s social environment and less by the introspective insight into one s individual preferences if there turns out to be a big discrepancy between the two it can provoke a more severe form of the sophomore crisis later on james marcia defines this early commitment without sufficient exploration as identity foreclosure the adult crisis usually starts in the mid to late 20s the issues faced in it overlap to some extent with the ones in the sophomore crisis but they tend to be more complex issues of identity as such they also circle around one s career and one s path in life but they tend to take more details into account like one s choice of religion one s political outlook or one s sexuality resolving the adult crisis means having a good idea of who one is as a person and being comfortable with this idea it is usually associated with reaching full adulthood having completed school working full time having left one s home and being financially independent being unable to resolve the adult crisis may result in disorientation a lack of confidence in one s personal identity and depression mid life among the different types of existential crises the mid life crisis is the one most widely discussed it often sets in around the age of 40 and can be triggered by the impression that one s personal growth is obstructed this may be combined with the sense that there is a significant distance between one s achievement and one s aspirations in contrast to the earlier existential crises it also involves a backward looking component previous choices in life are questioned and their meaning for one s achievements are assessed this may lead to regrets and dissatisfaction with one s life choices on various topics such as career partner children social status or missed opportunities the tendency to look backward is often connected to the impression that one is past one s peak period in life sometimes five intermediary stages are distinguished accommodation separation liminality reintegration and individuation in these stages the individual first adapts to changed external demands then addresses the distance between their innate motives and the external persona next rejects their previously adaptive persona later adopts their new persona and lastly becomes aware of the external consequences associated with these changes mid life crises can be triggered by specific events such as losing a job forced unemployment extramarital affairs separation death of a loved one or health problems in this sense the mid life crisis can be understood as a period of transition or reevaluation in which the individual tries to adapt to their changed situation in life both in response to the particular triggering event and to the more general changes that come with age various symptoms are associated with mid life crises such as stress boredom self doubt compulsivity changes in the libido and sexual preferences rumination and insecurity in public discourse the mid life crisis is primarily associated with men often in direct relation to their career but it affects women just as well an additional factor here is the limited time left in their reproductive period or the onset of the menopause between 8 and 25 percent of americans over the age of thirty five have experienced a mid life crisis both the severity and the length of the mid life crisis are often affected by whether and how well the earlier crises were resolved people who managed to resolve earlier crises well tend to feel more fulfilled with their life choices which also reflects in how their meaningfulness is perceived when looking back on them but it does not ensure that they still appear meaningful from one s current perspective later life the later life crisis often occurs around one s late 60s it may be triggered by events such as retirement the death of a loved one serious illness or imminent death at its core is a backward looking reflection on how one led one s life and the choices one made this reflection is usually motivated by a desire to have lived a valuable and meaningful life paired with an uncertainty of one s success a contemplation of one s past wrongdoings may also be motivated by a desire to find a way to make up for them while one still can it can also express itself in a more theoretical form as trying to assess whether one s life made a positive impact on one s more immediate environment or the world at large this is often associated with the desire to leave a positive and influential legacy behind because of its backward looking nature there may be less one can do to truly resolve the crisis this is true especially for people who arrive at a negative assessment of their life an additional impeding factor in contrast to earlier crises is that individuals are often unable to find the energy and youthfulness necessary to make meaningful changes to their lives some suggest that developing an acceptance of the reality of death may help in the process other suggestions focus less on outright resolving the crisis but more on avoiding or minimizing its negative impact recommendations to this end include looking after one s physical economic and emotional well being as well as developing and maintaining a social network of support the best way to avoid the crisis as much as possible may be to ensure that one s earlier crises in life are resolved meaninglessness most theorists see meaninglessness as the central issue around which existential crises revolve in this sense they may be understood as crises of meaning the issue of meaning and meaninglessness concerns various closely related questions understood in the widest sense it involves the global questions of the meaning of life in general why we are here or for what purpose we live answers to this question traditionally take the form of religious explanations for example that the world was created by god according to his purpose and that each thing is meaningful because it plays a role for this higher purpose this is sometimes termed cosmic meaning in contrast to the secular personal meaning an individual seeks when asking in what way their particular life is meaningful or valuable in this personal sense it is often connected with a practical confusion about how one should live one s life or why one should continue doing what one does this can express itself in the feeling that one has nothing to live for or to hope for sometimes this is even interpreted in the sense that there is no right and wrong or good and evil while it may be more and more difficult in the contemporary secular world to find cosmic meaning it has been argued that to resolve the problem of meaninglessness it is sufficient for the individual to find a secular personal meaning to hold onto the issue of meaninglessness becomes a problem because humans seem to have a strong desire or need for meaning this expresses itself both emotionally and practically since goals and ideals are needed to structure one s life the other side of the problem is given in the fact that there seems to be no such meaning or that the world is at its bottom contingent and could have existed in a very different way or not at all the world s contingency and indifference to human affairs are often referred to as the absurd in the existentialist literature the problem can be summarized through the question how does a being who needs meaning find meaning in a universe that has no meaning various practitioners of existential psychotherapy have affirmed that the loss of meaning plays a role for the majority of people requiring psychotherapy and is the central issue for a significant number of them but this loss has its most characteristic expression in existential crises various factors affect whether life is experienced as meaningful such as social relationships religion and thoughts about the past or future judgments of meaning are quite subjective they are a form of global assessment since they take one s life as a whole into consideration it is sometimes argued that the problem of a loss of meaning is particularly associated with modern society this is often based on the idea that people tended to be more grounded in their immediate social environment their profession and their religion in premodern times sources of meaning it is usually held that humans have a need for meaning this need may be satisfied by finding an accessible source of meaning religious faith can be a source of meaning and many studies demonstrate that it is associated with self reported meaning in life another important source of meaning is due to one s social relationships lacking or losing a source of meaning on the other hand often leads to an existential crisis in some cases this change is clearly linked to a specific source of meaning that becomes inaccessible for example a religious person confronted with the vast extent of death and suffering may find their faith in a benevolent omnipotent god shattered and thereby lose the ability to find meaning in life for others a concrete threat of imminent death for example due to the disruption of the social order can have a similar effect if the individual is unable to assimilate reinterpret or ignore this type of threatening information the loss of their primary source of meaning may force them to reevaluate their system of meaning in life from the ground up in this case the person is entering an existential crisis which can bring with it the need to question what other sources of meaning are accessible to them or whether there is meaning at all many different sources of meaning are discussed in the academic literature discovering such a source for oneself is often key to resolving an existential crisis the sources discussed in the literature can be divided into altruism dedication to a cause creativity hedonism self actualization and finding the right attitude altruism refers to the practice or attitude based on the desire to benefit others altruists aim to make the world a better place than they found it this can happen in various ways on a small scale one may try to be kinder to the people in one s immediate social environment it can include the effort to become aware of their problems and try to help them directly or indirectly but the altruistic attitude may also express itself in a less personal form towards strangers for example by donating money to charities effective altruism is an example of a contemporary movement promoting altruism and providing concrete advice on how to live altruistically it has been argued that altruism can be a strong source of meaning in one s life this is also reflected in the fact that altruists tend to enjoy higher levels of well being as well as increased physical and mental health dedicating oneself to a cause can act as a closely related source of meaning in many cases the two overlap if altruism is the primary motivation but this is not always the case since the fascination with a cause may not be explicitly linked to the desire to benefit others it consists in devoting oneself fully to producing something greater than oneself a diverse set of causes can be followed this way ranging from religious goals political movements or social institutions to scientific or philosophical ventures such causes provide meaning to one s life to the extent that one participates in the meaningfulness of the cause by working towards it and realizing it creativity refers to the activity of creating something new and exciting it can act as a source of meaning even if it is not obvious that the creation serves a specific purpose this aspect is especially relevant in the field of art where it is sometimes claimed that the work of art does not need an external justification since it is its own excuse for being it has been argued that for many great artists their keener vision of the existential dilemma of the human condition was the cause of their creative efforts these efforts in turn may have served them as a form of therapy but creativity is not limited to art it can be found and practiced in many different fields both on a big and a small scale such as in science cooking gardening writing regular work or romantic relationships the hedonistic approach can also constitute a source of meaning it is based on the idea that a life enjoyed to the fullest extent is meaningful even if it lacks any higher overarching purpose for this perspective it is relevant that hedonism is not understood in a vulgar sense i e as the pursuit of sensory pleasures characterized by a disregard of the long term consequences while such a lifestyle may be satisfying in certain respects a more refined form of hedonism that includes other forms of pleasures and considers their long term consequences is more commonly recommended in the academic literature this wider sense also includes more subtle pleasures such as looking at fine art or engaging in a stimulating intellectual conversation in this way life can be meaningful to the individual if it is seen as a gift evoking a sense of astonishment at its miracle and a general appreciation of it according to the perspective of self actualization each human carries within themselves a potential of what they may become the purpose of life then is to develop oneself to realize this potential and successfully doing so increases the individual s well being and sense of meaningfulness in this sense just like an acorn has the potential to become an oak so an infant has the potential to become a fully actualized adult with various virtues and skills based on their inborn talents the process of self actualization is sometimes understood in terms of a hierarchy certain lower potentials have to be actualized before the actualization of higher potentials becomes possible most of the approaches mentioned so far have clear practical implications in that they affect how the individual interacts with the world the attitudinal approach on the other hand identifies different sources of meaning based only on taking the right attitude towards life this concerns specifically negative situations in which one is faced with a fate that one cannot change in existential crises this often expresses itself in the feeling of helplessness the idea is that in such situations one can still find meaning based on taking a virtuous or admirable attitude towards one s suffering for example by remaining courageous whether a certain source of meaning is accessible differs from person to person it may also depend on the stage in life one finds oneself in similar to how different stages are often associated with different types of existential crises it has been argued for example that the concern with oneself and one s own well being found in self actualization and hedonism tends to be associated more with earlier stages in life the concern with others or the world at large found in altruism and the dedication to a cause on the other hand is more likely found in later stages in life for example when an older generation aims to pass on their knowledge and improve the lives of a younger generation consequences clinical manifestation and measurement going through an existential crisis is associated with a variety of consequences both for the affected individual and their social environment on the personal level the immediate effects are usually negative since experiencing an existential crisis is connected to stress anxiety and the formation of bad relationships this can lead all the way to depression if existential crises are not resolved on the social level they cause a high divorce rate and an increased number of people being unable to make significant positive contributions to society for example due to a lack of drive resulting from depression but if resolved properly they can also have positive effects by pushing the affected to address the underlying issue individuals may thereby find new sources of meaning develop as a person and thereby improve their way of life in the sophomore crisis for example this can happen by planning ahead and thereby making more conscious choices in how to lead one s life being aware of the symptoms and consequences of existential crises on the personal level is important for psychotherapists so they can arrive at an accurate diagnosis but this is not always easy since the symptoms usually differ from person to person in this sense the lack of meaning at the core of existential crises can express itself in several different ways for some it may lead them to become overly adventurous and zealous in their attempt to wrest themselves free from meaninglessness they are desperate to indiscriminately dedicate themselves to any cause they might do so without much concern for the concrete content of the cause or for their personal safety it has been argued that this type of behavior is present in some hardcore activists this may be understood as a form of defense mechanism in which the individual engages fanatically in activities in response to a deep sense of purposelessness it can also express itself in a related but less dramatic way as compulsive activity this may take various forms such as workaholism or the obsessive pursuit of prestige or material acquisitions this is sometimes referred to as false centering or inauthenticity since the activity is pursued more as a distraction and less because it is in itself fulfilling to the agent it can provide a temporary alleviation by helping the individual drain their energy and thus distract them from the threat of meaninglessness another response consists in an overt declaration of nihilism characterized by a pervasive tendency to discredit activities purported by others to have meaning such an individual may for example dismiss altruism out of hand as a disingenuous form of selfishness or see all leaders as motivated by their lust for power rather than inspired by a grand vision in some more extreme forms of crisis the individual s behavior may show severe forms of aimlessness and apathy often accompanied by depression being unable to find good reasons for making an effort such a person remains inactive for extended periods of time such as staying in bed all day if they engage in a behavior they may do so indiscriminately without much concern for what they are doing indirect factors for determining the severeness of an existential crisis include job satisfaction and the quality of one s relationships for example physical violence or constant fighting in a relationship may be interpreted as external signs of a serious existential crisis various empirical studies have shown that a lack of sense of meaning in life is associated with psychopathology having a positive sense of meaning on the other hand is associated with deeply held religious beliefs having a clear life goal and having dedicated oneself to a cause measurement different suggestions have been made concerning how to measure whether someone has an existential crisis to what degree it is present and which approach to resolving it might be promising these methods can help therapists and counselors to understand both whether their client is going through an existential crisis and if so how severe their crisis is but they can also be used by theorists in order to identify how existential crises correlate with other phenomena such as depression gender or poverty one way to assess this is through questionnaires focusing on topics like the meaning of life such as the purpose in life test and the life regard index the purpose in life test is widely used and consists of 20 items rated on a seven point scale such as in life i have 1 no goals or aims at all 7 very clear goals and aims or with regard to death i am 1 unprepared and frightened 7 prepared and unafraid resolution since existential crises can have a crippling effect on people it is important to find ways to resolve them different forms of resolution have been proposed the right approach often depends on the type of crisis experienced many approaches emphasize the importance of developing a new stage of intellectual functioning in order to resolve the inner conflict but others focus more on external changes for example crises related to one s sexual identity and one s level of independence may be resolved by finding a partner matching one s character and preferences positive indicators of marital success include having similar interests engaging in common activities and having a similar level of education crises centering around one s professional path may also be approached more externally by finding the right type of career in this respect important factors include that the career matches both one s interests and one s skills to avoid a job that is unfulfilling lacks engagement or is overwhelming but the more common approach aims at changing one s intellectual functioning and inner attitude existential psychotherapists for example usually try to resolve existential crises by helping the patient to rediscover meaning in their life sometimes this takes the form of finding a spiritual or religious purpose in life such as dedicating oneself to an ideal or discovering god other approaches focus less on the idea of discovering meaning and more on the idea of creating meaning this is based on the idea that meaning is not something independent of the agent out there but something that has to be created and maintained however there are also types of existentialist psychotherapy that accept the idea that the world is meaningless and try to develop the best way of coping with this fact the different approaches to resolving the issue of meaninglessness are sometimes divided into a leap of faith the reasoned approach and nihilism another classification categorizes possible resolutions as isolation anchoring distraction and sublimation methods from cognitive behavior therapy have also been used to treat existential crises by bringing about a change in the individual s intellectual functioning leap of faith reasoned approach and nihilism since existential crises circle around the idea of being unable to find meaning in life various resolutions focus on specifically this aspect sometimes three different forms of this approach are distinguished on the one hand the individual may perform a leap of faith and affirm a new system of meaning without a previous in depth understanding of how secure it is as a source of meaning another method consists in carefully considering all the relevant factors and thereby rebuilding and justifying a new system of meaning a third approach goes against these two by denying that there is actual meaning it consists in accepting the meaninglessness of life and learning how to deal with it without the illusion of meaning a leap of faith implies committing oneself to something one does not fully understand in the case of existential crises the commitment involves the faith that life is meaningful even though the believer lacks a reasoned justification this leap is motivated by the strong desire that life is meaningful and triggered as a response to the threat posed to the fulfillment of this desire by the existential crisis for whom this is psychologically possible this may be the fastest way to bypass an existential crisis this option may be more available to people oriented toward intuitive processing and less to people who favor a more rational approach since it has less need for a thorough reflection and introspection it has been argued that the meaning acquired through a leap of faith may be more robust than in other cases one reason for this is that since it is not based on empirical evidence for it it is also less vulnerable to empirical evidence against it another reason concerns the flexibility of intuition to selectively disregard threatening information on the one hand and to focus instead on validating cues more rationally inclined persons tend to focus more on a careful evaluation of the sources of meaning based on solid justification through empirical evidence if successful this approach has the advantage of providing the individual with a concrete and realistic understanding of how their life is meaningful it can also constitute a very robust source of meaning if it is based on solid empirical evidence and thorough understanding the system of meaning arrived at may be very idiosyncratic by being based on the individual s values preferences and experiences on a practical level it often leads to a more efficient realization of this meaning since the individual can focus more exclusively on this factor if someone determines that family life is their main source of meaning for example they may focus more intensely on this aspect and take a less involved stance towards other areas in life such as success at work in comparison to the leap of faith this approach offers more room for personal growth due to the cognitive labor in the form of reflection and introspection involved in it and the self knowledge resulting from this process one of the drawbacks of this approach is that it can take a considerable amount of time to complete and rid oneself of the negative psychological consequences if successful the foundations arrived at this way may provide a solid basis to withstand future existential crises but success is not certain and even after a prolonged search the individual might still be unable to identify a significant source of meaning in their life if the search for meaning in either way fails there is still another approach to resolving the issue of meaninglessness in existential crises to find a way to accept that life is meaningless this position is usually referred to as nihilism one can distinguish a local and a global version of this approach depending on whether the denial of meaningfulness is only directed at a certain area of life or at life as a whole it becomes necessary if the individual arrives at the justifiable conclusion that life is after all meaningless this conclusion may be intolerable initially since humans seem to have a strong desire to lead a meaningful life sometimes referred to as the will to meaning some theorists such as viktor frankl see this desire even as the primary motivation of all individuals one difficulty with this negative stance towards meaning is that it seems to provide very little practical guidance in how to live one s life so even if an individual has resolved their existential crises this way they may still lack an answer to the question of what they should do with their life positive aspects of this stance include that it can lead to a heightened sense of freedom by being unbound from any predetermined purpose it also exemplifies the virtue of truthfulness by being able to acknowledge an inconvenient truth instead of escaping into the convenient illusion of meaningfulness isolation anchoring distraction and sublimation according to peter wessel zapffe life is essentially meaningless but this does not mean that we are automatically doomed to unresolvable existential crises instead he identifies four ways of dealing with this fact without falling into an existential depression isolation anchoring distraction and sublimation isolation involves a dismissal of destructive thoughts and feelings from consciousness physicians and medical students for example may adopt a detached and technical stance in order to better deal with the tragic and disgusting aspects of their vocation anchoring involves a dedication to certain values and practical commitments that give the individual a sense of assurance this often happens collectively for example through devotion to a common religion but it can also happen individually distraction is a more temporary form of withdrawing one s attention from the meaninglessness of certain life situations that do not provide any significant contributions to the construction of our self sublimation is the rarest of these mechanisms its essential characteristic setting it apart from the other mechanisms is that it uses the pain of living and transforms it into a work of art or another creative expression cognitive behavioral therapy and social perspective taking some approaches from the field of cognitive behavioral therapy adjust and employ treatments for depression to resolve existential crises one fundamental idea in cognitive behavior theory is that various psychological problems arise due to inaccurate core beliefs about oneself such as beliefs that one is worthless helpless or incompetent these problematic core beliefs may lie dormant for extended periods but when activated by certain life events they may express themselves in the form of recurrent negative and damaging thoughts this can lead among other things to depression cognitive behavioral therapy then consists in raising the awareness of the affected person in regards to these toxic thought patterns and the underlying core beliefs while training to change them this can happen by focusing on one s immediate present being goal oriented role playing or behavioral experiments a closely related method employs the practice of social perspective taking social perspective taking involves the ability to assess one s situation and character from the point of view of a different individual this enables the individual to step outside their own immediate perspective while taking into consideration how others see the individual and thus reach a more integral perspective unresolved crises existential crises sometimes pass even if the underlying issue is not resolved this may happen for example if the issue is pushed into the background by other concerns and thus remains present only in a masked or dormant state but even in this state it may have unconscious effects on how people lead their life like career choices it can also increase the likelihood of suffering another existential crisis later on in life and might make resolving these later crises more difficult it has been argued that many existential crises in contemporary society are not resolved the reason for this may be a lack of clear awareness of the nature importance and possible treatments of existential crises cultural context in the 19th century thomas carlyle wrote of how the loss of faith in god results in an existential crisis which he called the centre of indifference wherein the world appears cold and unfeeling and the individual considers himself to be without worth s\u00f8ren kierkegaard considered that angst and existential despair would appear when an inherited or borrowed world view often of a collective nature proved unable to handle unexpected and extreme life experiences friedrich nietzsche extended his views to suggest that the death of god the loss of collective faith in religion and traditional morality created a more widespread existential crisis for the philosophically aware existential crisis has indeed been seen as the inevitable accompaniment of modernism c 1890 1945 whereas \u00e9mile durkheim saw individual crises as the by product of social pathology and a partial lack of collective norms others have seen existentialism as arising more broadly from the modernist crisis of the loss of meaning throughout the modern world its twin answers were either a religion revivified by the experience of anomie as with martin buber or an individualistic existentialism based on facing directly the absurd contingency of human fate within a meaningless and alien universe as with sartre and camus irvin yalom an emeritus professor of psychiatry at stanford university has made fundamental contributions to the field of existential psychotherapy rollo may is another of the founders of this approach fredric jameson has suggested that postmodernism with its saturation of social space by a visual consumer culture has replaced the modernist angst of the traditional subject and with it the existential crisis of old by a new social pathology of flattened affect and a fragmented subject historical context existential crises are often seen as a phenomenon associated specifically with modern society one important factor in this context is that various sources of meaning such as religion or being grounded in one s local culture and immediate social environment are less important in the contemporary context another factor in modern society is that individuals are faced with a daunting number of decisions to make and alternatives to choose from often without any clear guidelines on how to make these choices the high difficulty for finding the best alternative and the importance of doing so are often the cause of anxiety and may lead to an existential crisis for example it was very common for a long time in history for a son to simply follow his father s profession in contrast to this the modern schooling system presents students with different areas of study and interest thereby opening a wide range of career opportunities to them the problem brought about by this increased freedom is sometimes referred to as the agony of choice the increased difficulty is described in barry schwartz s law which links the costs time and energy needed to make a well informed choice to the number of alternatives available see also

the individual has an affiliation such alienation has been described as a condition in social relationships reflected by 1 a low degree of integration or common values and 2 a high degree of distance or isolation 3a between individuals or 3b between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment enumeration added it is a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists the concept has many discipline specific uses and can refer both to a personal psychological state subjectively and to a type of social relationship objectively history the term alienation has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings in ancient history it could mean a metaphysical sense of achieving a higher state of contemplation ecstasy or union becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world in a positive sense examples of this usage have been traced to neoplatonic philosophers such as plotinus in the greek alloiosis there have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from god and the faithful alienated in a negative sense the new testament mentions the term apallotrioomai in greek being alienated from ideas of estrangement from a golden age or due to a fall of man or approximate equivalents in differing cultures or religions have also been described as concepts of alienation a double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as gnosticism alienation also had a particular legal political meaning since as early as ancient roman times where to alienate property alienato is to transfer ownership of it to someone else the term alienation itself comes from the latin alienus which meant of another place or person which in turn came from alius meaning other or another another usage of the term in ancient greco roman times was by physicians referring to disturbed difficult or abnormal states of mind generally attributed to imbalanced physiology in latin alienatio mentis mental alienation this usage has been dated to asclepiades once translations of such works had resurfaced in the west in the 17th century physicians again began using the term which is typically attributed to felix platter in medieval times a relationship between alienation and social order has been described mediated in part by mysticism and monasticism the crusades and witch hunts have been described as forms of mass alienation 17th century in the 17th century hugo grotius put forward the concept that everyone has sovereign authority over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good an early social contract theory in the 18th century hutcheson introduced a distinction between alienable and unalienable rights in the legal sense of the term rousseau published influential works on the same theme and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological social concept relating to alienation from a state of nature due to the expansion of civil society or the nation state in the same century a law of alienation of affection was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away their woman in the history of literature the german romantics appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found around the start of the 19th century hegel popularized a christian lutheran and idealist philosophy of alienation he used german terms in partially different senses referring to a psychological state and an objective process and in general posited that the self was a historical and social creation which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived objective world but can become de alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self consciousness which may be achieved by self sacrifice to the common good around the same time pinel was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation particularly through his medical philosophical treatise he argued that people could be disturbed alienated by emotional states and social conditions without necessarily having lost become alienated from their reason as had generally been assumed hegel praised pinel for his moral treatment approach and developed related theories nevertheless as foucault would later write in an obscure shared origin the alienation of physicians and the alienation of philosophers started to take shape two configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth but between which after hegel the nineteenth century stopped seeing any trace of resemblance marx marx was initially in the young hegelian camp and like feuerbach rejected the spiritual basis and adapted hegel s dialectic model to a theory of historical materialism marx s theory of alienation is articulated most clearly in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 and the german ideology 1846 the young marx wrote more often and directly of alienation than the mature marx which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central structuralists generally hold that there was a transition from a philosophical anthropological marxist humanism concept e g internal alienation from the self to a structural historical interpretation e g external alienation by appropriation of labor accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to exploitation to commodity fetishism and reification marx s concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by kostas axelos economic and social alienation political alienation human alienation and ideological alienation in the concept s most prominent use it refers to the economic and social alienation aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism essentially there is an exploitation of men by men where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy his theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging industrial production under capitalism workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work workers never become autonomous self realized human beings in any significant sense except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized his theory relies on feuerbach s the essence of christianity 1841 which argues that the idea of god has alienated the characteristics of the human being stirner would take the analysis further in the ego and its own 1844 declaring that even humanity is an alienating ideal for the individual to which marx and engels responded in the german ideology 1845 alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in work each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned for which each individual functions as an instrument not as a social being kostas axelos summarizes that for marx in capitalism work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products the malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself does not feel content but unhappy the worker only feels himself outside his work and in his work he feels outside himself its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists it is avoided like the plague marx also wrote in a curtailed manner that capitalist owners also experience alienation through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society political alienation refers specifically to the idea that politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy in a way that is alienating because it distorts the logic of economic development through human alienation individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive where they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls historical conditions the first aspect refers to the necessity of food clothes shelter and more secondly marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more needs or desires that they will work towards satisfying hence humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other when referring to ideological alienation axelos proposes that marx believes that all religions divert people away from their true happiness and instead turn them towards illusory happiness there is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from german language philosophical texts the word alienation and similar words such as estrangement are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct german words entfremdung and ent\u00e4u\u00dferung the former means specifically interpersonal estrangement while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization relinquishment or sale alienation of property in general and contrary to his predecessors marx may have used the terms interchangeably though he also wrote entfremdung constitutes the real interest of this ent\u00e4u\u00dferung late 1800s to 1900s many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization german sociologists georg simmel and ferdinand t\u00f6nnies wrote critical works on individualization and urbanization simmel s the philosophy of money describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money t\u00f6nnies gemeinschaft and gesellschaft community and society is about the loss of primary relationships such as familial bonds in favour of goal oriented secondary relationships this idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts although the term may not be as frequently used in the context of an individual s relationships within society alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society when collective decisions are made it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account the american sociologist c wright mills conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with white collar in 1951 describing how modern consumption capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work melvin seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid 20th century when he published his paper on the meaning of alienation in 1959 seeman used the insights of marx emile durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation powerlessness meaninglessness normlessness isolation and self estrangement seeman later added a sixth element cultural estrangement although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work in a broader philosophical context especially in existentialism and phenomenology alienation describes the inadequacy of the human being or the mind in relation to the world the human mind as the subject who perceives sees the world as an object of perception and is distanced from the world rather than living within it this line of thought is generally traced to the works of s\u00f8ren kierkegaard in the 19th century who from a christian viewpoint saw alienation as separation from god and also examined the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices many 20th century philosophers both theistic and atheistic and theologians were influenced by kierkegaard s notions of angst despair and the importance of the individual martin heidegger s concepts of anxiety angst and mortality drew from kierkegaard he is indebted to the way kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth our existence in the face of death the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one s being in the world jean paul sartre described the thing in itself which is infinite and overflowing and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing in itself is reflective consciousness since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre reflective sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety i e the human condition as well sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the other meaning beings or objects that are not the self their self consciousness has a masochistic desire to be limited this is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play no exit hell is other people in the theory of psychoanalysis developed around the start of the 20th century sigmund freud did not explicitly address the concept of alienation but other analysts subsequently have it is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and unconscious mind between different parts of a hypothetical psychic apparatus and between the self and civilization it postulates defense mechanisms including splitting in both normal and disturbed functioning the concept of repression has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of false consciousness associated with marxist theory a form of western marxism developed during the century which included influential analyses of false consciousness by gy\u00f6rgy luk\u00e1cs critics of bureaucracy and the protestant ethic also drew on the works of max weber figures associated with critical theory in particular with the frankfurt school such as theodor adorno and erich fromm also developed theories of alienation drawing on neo marxist ideas as well as other influences including neo freudian and sociological theories one approach applies marxist theories of commodification to the cultural educational and party political spheres links are drawn between socioeconomic structures psychological states of alienation and personal human relationships in the 1960s the revolutionary group situationist international came to some prominence staging situations intended to highlight an alternative way of life to advanced capitalism the latter conceptualized as a diffuse spectacle a fake reality masking a degradation of human life the theory of communicative action associated with j\u00fcrgen habermas emphasizes the essential role of language in public life suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of market forces and state power this critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust after the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s interest in alienation research subsided although in sociology it was maintained by the research committee on alienation of the international sociological association isa in the 1990s there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the soviet union globalization the information explosion increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts and post modernism felix geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment in late 20th and early 21st century sociology it has been particularly the works of lauren langman and devorah kalekin fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world modalities powerlessness alienation in the sense of a lack of power has been technically defined by seeman as the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes or reinforcements he seeks seeman argues that this is the notion of alienation as it originated in the marxian view of the worker s condition in capitalist society the worker is alienated to the extent that the prerogative and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs more succinctly kalekin fishman says a person suffers from alienation in the form of powerlessness when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing in discussing powerlessness seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist julian rotter rotter distinguishes between internal control and external locus of control which means differences among persons or situations in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors e g luck chance or powerful others as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one s personal skills or characteristics powerlessness therefore is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals ultimately breaking with the marxist tradition geyer remarks that a new type of powerlessness has emerged where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an overchoice of alternatives for action whose consequences one often cannot even fathom geyer adapts cybernetics to alienation theory and writes that powerlessness is the result of delayed feedback the more complex one s environment the later one is confronted with the latent and often unintended consequences of one s actions consequently in view of this causality obscuring time lag both the rewards and punishments for one s actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random often with apathy and alienation as a result meaninglessness a sense of meaning has been defined by seeman as the individual s sense of understanding events in which he is engaged seeman writes that meaninglessness is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes in this respect meaninglessness is closely tied to powerlessness seeman argues the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control that is high powerlessness geyer believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times with the accelerating throughput of information meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal relevant information one needs as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need but is bombarded with on a regular basis information overload or the so called data tsunami are well known information problems confronting contemporary man and geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head normlessness normlessness or what durkheim referred to as anomie denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour this aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather with values that are perceived to be dominant seeman adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner the anomic situation may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals neal and collas write that n ormlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct this is a particular issue after the fall of the soviet union mass migrations from developing to developed countries and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s relationships one concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of parental alienation where a separated child expresses a general dislike for one of their parents who may have divorced or separated the term is not applied where there is child abuse the parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the social dynamics of the family as a whole it can also be understood in terms of attachment the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver adoptees can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents familial estrangement between parents and adult children is attributed to a number of biological psychological social and structural factors affecting the family including attachment disorders incompatible values and beliefs unfulfilled expectations critical life events and transitions parental alienation and ineffective communication patterns the degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma attachment relationships in adults can also involve feelings of alienation indeed emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many whether it is experienced as overwhelming unacknowledged in the midst of a socioeconomic race or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems social isolation social isolation refers to the feeling of being segregated from one s community neal and collas emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world while social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world with increased isolation and atomization much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships since the fall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war migrants from eastern europe and developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard this has led to entire communities becoming uprooted no longer fully part of their homelands but neither integrated into their adopted communities diaspora literature depicts the plights of these migrants such as hafid bouazza in paravion political alienation one manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from the political system and a lack of engagement therein such political alienation could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message and could result in revolution reforming behavior or abstention from the political process possibly due to voter apathy a similar concept is policy alienation where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a policy programme being implemented self estrangement self estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology as recognized by seeman although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation some with marx consider self estrangement to be the result and thus the heart of social alienation self estrangement can be defined as the psychological state of denying one s own interests of seeking out extrinsically rather than intrinsically satisfying activities it could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself or to some parts of oneself or alternatively as a problem of self knowledge or authenticity seeman recognized the problems inherent in defining the self while post modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin pointing what precisely self constitutes further in that way if the self is relationally constituted does it make sense to speak of self estrangement rather than social isolation costas and fleming suggest that although the concept of self estrangement has not weathered postmodern criticisms of essentialism and economic determinism well the concept still has value if a lacanian reading of the self is adopted this can be seen as part of a wider debate on the concept of self between humanism and antihumanism structuralism and post structuralism or nature and nurture mental disturbance until early in the 20th century psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation implying that a person had become separated from themselves their reason or the world from the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance typically using a broad concept of a schizoid splitting process taken from psychoanalytic theory the splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as schizoid personality and schizophrenia varied concepts of alienation and self estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation r d laing was particularly influential in arguing that dysfunctional families and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and ontological insecurity in people which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society the specific theories associated with laing and others at that time are not widely accepted but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme in a related vein for ian parker psychology normalizes conditions of social alienation while it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions this view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as critical psychology or liberation psychology which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social political framework and so therefore are psychological problems likewise some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context slavoj zizek drawing on herbert marcuse michel foucault and jacques lacan s psychoanalysis argues that in today s capitalist society the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to enjoy such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and indeed could itself be seen as an expression of alienation more to the political right however psychotherapy and associated notions have long been considered anywhere from ineffectual due to their inherent bias against the reality of inborn such as group specific genetic traits to actively destructive much rather than emancipatory on the other hand they are not alone in this sentiment either as marcuse among others goes on to speak of repressive desublimation disability differences between persons with disabilities and individuals in relative abilities or perceived abilities can be a cause of alienation one study social alienation and peer identification a study of the social construction of deafness found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience social rejection by and alienation from the larger hearing community only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction this appeared to be related to specific needs for example for real conversation for information the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family it was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people sometimes resulting in marginalization of the deaf which is sometimes challenged it has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring criticisms eric voegelin with whom also originates the related phrase to immanentize the eschaton may be read as rather accepting of alienation the human condition has radical limits and humans do not feel perfectly comfortable to say the least but it is not ideological to feel dissatisfaction or to desire something more perfect than what we have indeed such feelings as disquiet anxiety frustration and even alienation are according voegelin normal man is in deadly anguish writes voegelin because he takes life seriously and cannot bear existence without meaning for reflection on the limits of the human condition to give rise to ideology a certain mood must be present what is this mood it is the mood not only of alienation but of revolt ideology involves the active revolt against existential truth and the effort to construct a different world voegelin designates this mood as pneumopathological a term he found in schelling it is the feeling of estrangement from the spirit so intense that it entails a willful closing of the soul to the transcendent philosophers heidegger peter sloterdijk and more recently alexander grau argue for a similar fact of alienation in art and popular culture alienation is most often represented in literature as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community in a volume of bloom s literary themes shakespeare s hamlet is described as the supreme literary portrait of alienation while noting that some may argue for achilles in the iliad in addition bartleby the scrivener is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are the bell jar black boy brave new world the catcher in the rye the chosen dubliners othello fahrenheit 451 invisible man mrs dalloway notes from underground one flew over the cuckoo s nest the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde the stranger and the myth of sisyphus the trial the castle waiting for godot the waste land and young goodman brown contemporary british works noted for their perspective on alienation include the child in time london fields trainspotting and regeneration sociologist harry dahms has analysed the matrix trilogy of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society he suggests that the central theme of the matrix is the all pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it british progressive rock band pink floyd s concept album the wall 1979 and british alternative rock band radiohead

succession of images ideas emotions and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep humans spend about two hours dreaming per night and each dream lasts around 5 20 minutes although the dreamer may perceive the dream as being much longer the content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history dream interpretation practiced by the babylonians in the third millennium bce and even earlier by the ancient sumerians figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions and has played a lead role in psychotherapy the scientific study of dreams is called oneirology most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function it is not known where in the brain dreams originate if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind the human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history long ago according to writings from mesopotamia and ancient egypt dreams dictated post dream behaviors to an extent that was sharply reduced in later millennia these ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams where a dream figure usually a deity or a prominent forebear commands the dreamer to take specific actions and which may predict future events framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time dreaming and sleep are intertwined dreams occur mainly in the rapid eye movement rem stage of sleep when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake because rem sleep is detectable in many species and because research suggests that all mammals experience rem linking dreams to rem sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream however humans dream during non rem sleep also and not all rem awakenings elicit dream reports to be studied a dream must first be reduced to a verbal report which is an account of the subject s memory of the dream not the subject s dream experience itself so dreaming by non humans is currently unprovable as is dreaming by human fetuses and pre verbal infants subjective experience and content preserved writings from early mediterranean civilizations indicate a relatively abrupt change in subjective dream experience between bronze age antiquity and the beginnings of the classical era in visitation dreams reported in ancient writings dreamers were largely passive in their dreams and visual content served primarily to frame authoritative auditory messaging gudea the king of the sumerian city state of lagash reigned c 2144 2124 bce rebuilt the temple of ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so after antiquity the passive hearing of visitation dreams essentially gave way to visualized narratives in which the dreamer becomes a character who actively participates from the 1940s to 1985 calvin s hall collected more than 50 000 dream reports at western reserve university in 1966 hall and robert van de castle published the content analysis of dreams outlining a coding system to study 1 000 dream reports from college students results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content the only residue of antiquity s authoritative dream figure in the hall and van de castle listing of dream characters is the inclusion of god in the category of prominent persons hall s complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid 1990s by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 william domhoff more recent studies of dream reports while providing more detail continue to cite the hall study favorably in the hall study the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety other emotions included abandonment anger fear joy and happiness negative emotions were much more common than positive ones the hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no more than 10 of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid teens another study showed that 8 of both men s and women s dreams have sexual content in some cases sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions these are colloquially known as wet dreams the visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric that is different locations and objects continuously blend into each other the visuals including locations people and objects are generally reflective of a person s memories and experiences but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new complex worlds and awakes with ideas thoughts and feelings never experienced before the dream people who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams their dream contents are related to other senses such as hearing touch smell and taste whichever are present since birth effects of regional or global catastrophes the covid 19 pandemic also influenced the content of people s dreams according to a scientific study of over 15 000 dream reports by deirdre barrett this analysis revealed that themes involving fear illness and death were two to four times more prevalent in dreams following the onset of the pandemic than they were before neurophysiology dream study is popular with scientists exploring the mind brain problem some propose to reduce aspects of dream phenomenology to neurobiology but current science cannot specify dream physiology in detail protocols in most nations restrict human brain research to non invasive procedures in the united states invasive brain procedures with a human subject are allowed only when these are deemed necessary in surgical treatment to address medical needs of the same human subject non invasive measures of brain activity like electroencephalogram eeg voltage averaging or cerebral blood flow cannot identify small but influential neuronal populations also fmri signals are too slow to explain how brains compute in real time scientists researching some brain functions can work around current restrictions by examining animal subjects as stated by the society for neuroscience because no adequate alternatives exist much of this research must sic be done on animal subjects however since animal dreaming can be only inferred not confirmed animal studies yield no hard facts to illuminate the neurophysiology of dreams examining human subjects with brain lesions can provide clues but the lesion method cannot discriminate between the effects of destruction and disconnection and cannot target specific neuronal groups in heterogeneous regions like the brain stem generation denied precision tools and obliged to depend on imaging much dream research has succumbed to the law of the instrument studies detect an increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that region with a role in generating dreams but pooling study results has led to the newer conclusion that dreaming involves large numbers of regions and pathways which likely are different for different dream events image creation in the brain involves significant neural activity downstream from eye intake and it is theorized that the visual imagery of dreams is produced by activation during sleep of the same structures that generate complex visual imagery in waking perception dreams present a running narrative rather than exclusively visual imagery following their work with split brain subjects gazzaniga and ledoux postulated without attempting to specify the neural mechanisms a left brain interpreter that seeks to create a plausible narrative from whatever electro chemical signals reach the brain s left hemisphere sleep research has determined that some brain regions fully active during waking are during rem sleep activated only in a partial or fragmentary way drawing on this knowledge textbook author james w kalat explains a dream represents the brain s effort to make sense of sparse and distorted information the cortex combines this haphazard input with whatever other activity was already occurring and does its best to synthesize a story that makes sense of the information neuroscientist indre viskontas is even more blunt calling often bizarre dream content just the result of your interpreter trying to create a story out of random neural signaling theories on function for many humans across multiple eras and cultures dreams are believed to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from gods or other external entities ancient egyptians believed that dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation and thus they would induce or incubate dreams they went to sanctuaries and slept on special dream beds in hope of receiving advice comfort or healing from the gods from a darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement provide some benefit for natural selection to take place or at least have no negative impact on fitness robert 1886 a physician from hamburg was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase a sensory impressions that were not fully worked up and b ideas that were not fully developed during the day in dreams incomplete material is either removed suppressed or deepened and included into memory freud whose dream studies focused on interpreting dreams not explaining how or why humans dream disputed robert s hypothesis and proposed that dreams preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise would awaken the dreamer freud wrote that dreams serve the purpose of prolonging sleep instead of waking up dreams are the guardians of sleep and not its disturbers a turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953 when science published the aserinsky and kleitman paper establishing rem sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to rem sleep until and even after publication of the solms 2000 paper that certified the separability of rem sleep and dream phenomena many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact been studying not dreams but measurable rem sleep theories of dream function since the identification of rem sleep include hobson s and mccarley s 1977 activation synthesis hypothesis which proposed a functional role for dreaming sleep in promoting some aspect of the learning process in 2010 a harvard study was published showing experimental evidence that dreams were correlated with improved learning crick s and mitchison s 1983 reverse learning theory which states that dreams are like the cleaning up operations of computers when they are offline removing suppressing parasitic nodes and other junk from the mind during sleep hartmann s 1995 proposal that dreams serve a quasi therapeutic function enabling the dreamer to process trauma in a safe place revonsuo s 2000 threat simulation hypothesis whose premise is that during much of human evolution physical and interpersonal threats were serious giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them dreaming aided survival by replicating these threats and providing the dreamer with practice in dealing with them in 2015 revonsuo proposed social simulation theory which describes dreams as a simulation for training social skills and bonds eagleman s and vaughn s 2021 defensive activation theory which says that given the brain s neuroplasticity dreams evolved as a visual hallucinatory activity during sleep s extended periods of darkness busying the occipital lobe and thereby protecting it from possible appropriation by other non vision sense operations erik hoel proposes based on artificial neural networks that dreams prevent overfitting to past experiences that is they enable the dreamer to learn from novel situations religious and other cultural contexts dreams figure prominently in major world religions the dream experience for early humans according to one interpretation gave rise to the notion of a human soul a central element in much religious thought j w dunne wrote but there can be no reasonable doubt that the idea of a soul must have first arisen in the mind of primitive man as a result of observation of his dreams ignorant as he was he could have come to no other conclusion but that in dreams he left his sleeping body in one universe and went wandering off into another it is considered that but for that savage the idea of such a thing as a soul would never have even occurred to mankind hindu in the mandukya upanishad part of the veda scriptures of indian hinduism a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state the earliest upanishads written before 300 bce emphasize two meanings of dreams the first says that dreams are merely expressions of inner desires the second is the belief of the soul leaving the body and being guided until awakened abrahamic in judaism dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered it is discussed in the talmud tractate berachot 55 60 the ancient hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion though the hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the voice of one god alone hebrews also differentiated between good dreams from god and bad dreams from evil spirits the hebrews like many other ancient cultures incubated dreams in order to receive a divine revelation for example the hebrew prophet samuel would lie down and sleep in the temple at shiloh before the ark and receive the word of the lord and joseph interpreted a pharaoh s dream of seven lean cows swallowing seven fat cows as meaning the subsequent seven years would be bountiful followed by seven years of famine most of the dreams in the bible are in the book of genesis christians mostly shared the beliefs of the hebrews and thought that dreams were of a supernatural character because the old testament includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration the most famous of these dream stories was jacob s dream of a ladder that stretches from earth to heaven many christians preach that god can speak to people through their dreams the famous glossary the somniale danielis written in the name of daniel attempted to teach christian populations to interpret their dreams iain r edgar has researched the role of dreams in islam he has argued that dreams play an important role in the history of islam and the lives of muslims since dream interpretation is the only way that muslims can receive revelations from god since the death of the last prophet muhammad according to edgar islam classifies three types of dreams firstly there is the true dream al ru ya then the false dream which may come from the devil shaytan and finally the meaningless everyday dream hulm this last dream could be brought forth by the dreamer s ego or base appetite based on what they experienced in the real world the true dream is often indicated by islam s hadith tradition in one narration by aisha the wife of the prophet it is said that the prophet s dreams would come true like the ocean s waves just as in its predecessors the quran also recounts the story of joseph and his unique ability to interpret dreams in both christianity and islam dreams feature in conversion stories according to ancient authors constantine the great started his conversion to christianity because he had a dream which prophesied that he would win the battle of the milvian bridge if he adopted the chi rho as his battle standard buddhist in buddhism ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk traditions in south asia the same dream is sometimes experienced by multiple people as in the case of the buddha to be before he is leaving his home it is described in the mah\u0101vastu that several of the buddha s relatives had premonitory dreams preceding this some dreams are also seen to transcend time the buddha to be has certain dreams that are the same as those of previous buddhas the lalitavistara states in buddhist literature dreams often function as a signpost motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the p\u0101li commentaries and the milinda pa\u00f1h\u0101 other in chinese history people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream realm while the other remained in the body this belief and dream interpretation had been questioned since early times such as by the philosopher wang chong 27 97 ce the babylonians and assyrians divided dreams into good which were sent by the gods and bad sent by demons a surviving collection of dream omens entitled i\u0161kar zaq\u012bqu records various dream scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person who experiences each dream apparently based on previous cases some list different possible outcomes based on occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different results the greeks shared their beliefs with the egyptians on how to interpret good and bad dreams and the idea of incubating dreams morpheus the greek god of dreams also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples the earliest greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers where they entered through a keyhole exiting the same way after the divine message was given antiphon wrote the first known greek book on dreams in the 5th century bce in that century other cultures influenced greeks to develop the belief that souls left the sleeping body the father of modern medicine hippocrates 460 375 bce thought dreams could analyze illness and predict diseases for instance a dream of a dim star high in the night sky indicated problems in the head region while low in the night sky indicated bowel issues galen 129 216 ad believed the same thing greek philosopher plato 427 347 bce wrote that people harbor secret repressed desires such as incest murder adultery and conquest which build up during the day and run rampant during the night in dreams plato s student aristotle 384 322 bce believed dreams were caused by processing incomplete physiological activity during sleep such as eyes trying to see while the sleeper s eyelids were closed marcus tullius cicero for his part believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days cicero s somnium scipionis described a lengthy dream vision which in turn was commented on by macrobius in his commentarii in somnium scipionis herodotus in his the histories writes the visions that occur to us in dreams are more often than not the things we have been concerned about during the day the dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous australians for a personal or group creation and for what may be understood as the timeless time of formative creation and perpetual creating some indigenous american tribes and mexican populations believe that dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their ancestors some native american tribes have used vision quests as a rite of passage fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding dream was received to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their return interpretation beginning in the late 19th century austrian neurologist sigmund freud founder of psychoanalysis theorized that dreams reflect the dreamer s unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by unconscious wish fulfillment he argued that important unconscious desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences carl jung and others expanded on freud s idea that dream content reflects the dreamer s unconscious desires dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and experiences one study found that most people believe that their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths the researchers surveyed students in the united states south korea and india and found that 74 of indians 65 of south koreans and 56 of americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires this freudian view of dreaming was believed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation problem solving or as a byproduct of unrelated brain activity the same study found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake americans were more likely to report that they would intentionally miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying while awake and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take participants in the study were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake they were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked for example and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked according to surveys it is common for people to feel their dreams are predicting subsequent life events psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of memory biases namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences the multi faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events the term veridical dream has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer whether future events or secrets in one experiment subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary this prevented the selective memory effect and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams this diary described events from the person s life as well as some predictive dreams and some non predictive dreams when subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones images and literature graphic artists writers and filmmakers all have found dreams to offer a rich vein for creative expression in the west artists depictions of dreams in renaissance and baroque art often were related to biblical narrative especially preferred by visual artists were the jacob s ladder dream in genesis and st joseph s dreams in the gospel according to matthew many later graphic artists have depicted dreams including japanese woodblock artist hokusai 1760 1849 and western european painters rousseau 1844 1910 picasso 1881 1973 and dal\u00ed 1904 1989 in literature dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory to justify the narrative the book of the duchess and the vision concerning piers plowman are two such dream visions even before them in antiquity the same device had been used by cicero and lucian of samosata dreams have also featured in fantasy and speculative fiction since the 19th century one of the best known dream worlds is wonderland from lewis carroll s alice s adventures in wonderland as well as looking glass land from its sequel through the looking glass unlike many dream worlds carroll s logic is like that of actual dreams with transitions and flexible causality other fictional dream worlds include the dreamlands of h p lovecraft s dream cycle and the neverending story s world of fantastica which includes places like the desert of lost dreams the sea of possibilities and the swamps of sadness dreamworlds shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by philip k dick such as the three stigmata of palmer eldritch and ubik similar themes were explored by jorge luis borges for instance in the circular ruins modern popular culture often conceives of dreams as did freud as expressions of the dreamer s deepest fears and desires in speculative fiction the line between dreams and reality may be blurred even more in service to the story dreams may be psychically invaded or manipulated dreamscape 1984 the nightmare on elm street films 1984 2010 inception 2010 or even come literally true as in the lathe of heaven 1971 lucidity lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one s state while dreaming in this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as lucid a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming the occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified oneironaut is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream in 1975 psychologist keith hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream on april 12 1975 after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid the subject and hearne s co author on the resulting article alan worsley successfully carried out this task years later psychophysiologist stephen laberge conducted similar work including using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake and while dreaming studies comparing in dream sex arousal and orgasm communication between two dreamers has also been documented the processes involved included eeg monitoring ocular signaling incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a coordinating website the website tracked when both dreamers were dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was incorporated into the dream this dreamer upon becoming lucid signaled with eye movements this was detected by the website whereupon the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer invoking incorporation into that dreamer s dream recollection the recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable though it is a skill that can be trained dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect and factors such as salience arousal and interference play a role in dream recall often a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus the salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient that is novel intense or unusual is more easily remembered there is considerable evidence that vivid intense or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled a dream journal can be used to assist dream recall for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes adults report remembering around two dreams per week on average unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it the content of the dream is typically not remembered in line with the salience hypothesis there is considerable evidence that people who have more vivid intense or unusual dreams show better recall there is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall specifically people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall people who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity imagination and fantasy such as openness to experience daydreaming fantasy proneness absorption and hypnotic susceptibility tend to show more frequent dream recall there is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience that is people who report more bizarre experiences during the day such as people high in schizotypy psychosis proneness have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares dream recording machine recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall using the permitted non invasive technologies functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and electromyography emg researchers have been able to identify basic dream imagery dream speech activity and dream motor behavior such as walking and hand movements miscellany illusion of reality some philosophers have proposed that what we think of as the real world could be or is an illusion an idea known as the skeptical hypothesis about ontology the first recorded mention of the idea was in the 4th century bce by zhuangzi and in eastern philosophy the problem has been named the zhuangzi paradox he who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt while he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream only after he wakes does he know it was a dream and someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream yet the stupid believe they are awake busily and brightly assuming they understand things calling this man ruler that one herdsman how dense confucius and you are both dreaming and when i say you are dreaming i am dreaming too words like these will be labeled the supreme swindle yet after ten thousand generations a great sage may appear who will know their meaning and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed the idea also is discussed in hindu and buddhist writings it was formally introduced to western philosophy by descartes in the 17th century in his meditations on first philosophy absent minded transgression dreams of absent minded transgression damt are dreams wherein the dreamer absent mindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette subjects who have had damt have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt one study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior non rem dreams hypnogogic and hypnopompic dreams dreamlike states shortly after falling asleep and shortly before awakening and dreams during stage 2 of nrem sleep also occur but are shorter than rem dreams daydreams a daydream is a visionary fantasy especially one of happy pleasant thoughts hopes or ambitions imagined as coming to pass and experienced while awake there are many different types of daydreams and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists the general public also uses the term for a broad variety of experiences research by harvard psychologist deirdre barrett has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike mental images reserve the word for these whereas many other people refer to milder imagery realistic future planning review of memories or just spacing out i e one s mind going relatively blank when they talk about daydreaming while daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy non productive pastime it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts there are numerous examples of people in creative or artistic careers such as composers novelists and filmmakers developing new ideas through daydreaming similarly research scientists mathematicians and physicists have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas hallucination a hallucination in the broadest sense of the word is a perception in the absence of a stimulus in a stricter sense hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state in the absence of external stimuli and have qualities of real perception in that they are vivid substantial and located in external objective space the latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming which does not involve wakefulness nightmare a nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind typically fear or horror but also despair anxiety and great sadness the dream may contain situations of danger discomfort psychological or physical terror sufferers usually awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a prolonged period of time night terror a night terror also known as a sleep terror or pavor nocturnus is a parasomnia disorder that predominantly affects children causing feelings of terror or dread night terrors should not be confused with nightmares which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu one theory of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake melatonin melatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the brain s pineal gland inducing nocturnal behaviors in animals and sleep in humans during nighttime chemically isolated in 1958 melatonin has been marketed as a sleep aid since the 1990s and is currently sold in the united states as an over the counter product requiring no prescription anecdotal reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid dreams see also references further reading dreaming journal published by the american psychological association jung carl 1934 the

family when they were not working during the great depression academics philip eisenberg and paul lazarsfeld wrote that a sudden negative change in one s circumstances especially a loss of a job could lead to decreased self confidence but more commonly if the jobless person believes the fault of his unemployment is his they also noted how if individuals do not have a job long enough they become apathetic and lose all self confidence in 1943 american psychologist abraham maslow argued in his paper a theory of human motivation that an individual is only motivated to acquire self confidence one component of esteem after achieving what they need for physiological survival safety and love and belonging he claimed that satisfaction with self esteem led to feelings of self confidence that once attained led to a desire for self actualization as material standards of most people rapidly rose in developed countries after world war ii and fulfilled their material needs a plethora of widely cited academic research about confidence and related concepts like self esteem and self efficacy emerged research measures one of the earliest measures of self confidence used a 12 point scale ranging from a minimum score characterizing someone who is timid and self distrustful shy never makes decisions self effacing to a maximum score characterizing someone who is able to make decisions absolutely confident and sure of his own decisions and opinions some researchers have measured self confidence as a simple construct divided into affective and cognitive components anxiety as an affective aspect and self evaluations of proficiency as a cognitive component other researchers have used body language proxies rather than self reports to measure self confidence by having examiners measure on a scale of 1 to 5 the subject s body language such as eye contact fidgeting posture facial expressions and gestures some methods measure self esteem and self confidence in various aspects or activities such as speaking in public spaces academic performance physical appearance romantic relationships social interactions and athletic ability in sports researchers have measured athletes confidence about winning upcoming matches and how sensitive respondents self confidence is to performance and negative feedback abraham maslow and others have emphasized the need to distinguish between self confidence as a generalized personality characteristic and self confidence concerning a specific task ability or challenge i e self efficacy the term self confidence typically refers to a general personality trait in contrast self efficacy is defined by psychologist albert bandura as a belief in one s ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task factors correlated with self confidence various factors within and beyond an individual s control may affect their self confidence an individual s self confidence can vary in different environments such as at home or at school and concerning different types of relationships and situations when people attribute their success to a matter under their control they are less likely to be confident about being successful in the future if someone attributes their failure to a factor beyond their control they are more likely to be confident about succeeding in the future if a person believes they failed to achieve a goal because of a factor that was beyond their control they are more likely to be more self confident that they can achieve the goal in the future one s self confidence often increases as one satisfactorily completes particular activities american social psychologist leon festinger found that self confidence in an individual s ability may only rise or fall when that individual can compare themselves to others who are roughly similar in a competitive environment a person can possess self confidence in their ability to complete a specific task self efficacy e g cook a good meal or write a good novel even though they may lack general self confidence or conversely be self confident though they lack the self efficacy to achieve a particular task these two types of self confidence are however correlated with each other and for this reason can be easily conflated social psychologists have found self confidence to be correlated with other psychological variables including saving money influencing others and being a responsible student self confidence affects interest enthusiasm and self regulation self confidence is important for accomplishing goals and improving performance marketing researchers have found that the general self confidence of a person is negatively correlated with their level of anxiety self confidence increases a person s general well being and one s motivation which often increases performance it also increases one s ability to deal with stress and mental health the more self confident an individual is the less likely they are to conform to the judgments of others higher confidence is correlated with individuals setting higher goals when people face feelings of discontent because they do not accomplish a certain goal people who have higher self confidence may become even more persistent in accomplishing their goals whereas those with low self confidence are more prone to giving up quickly albert bandura argued that a person s perceived confidence indicates capability if people do not believe that they are capable of coping they experience disruption which lowers their confidence about their performance salespeople who are high in self confidence tend to set higher goals for themselves which makes them more likely to stay employed yield higher revenues and generate higher customer service satisfaction in certain fields of medical practice patients experience a lack of self confidence during the recovery period this is commonly referred to as dsf or defectum sui fiducia from the latin for lack of self confidence this can be the case after a stroke when the patient refrains from using a weaker lower limb due to fear of it not being strong enough on the overconfidence effect martin hilbert argues that confidence bias can be explained by a noisy conversion of objective evidence into subjective estimates where noise is defined as the mixing of memories during the observing and remembering process dominic d p johnson and james h fowler write that overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition in studies of implicit self esteem researchers have found that people may consciously overreport their levels of self esteem inaccurate self evaluation is commonly observed in healthy populations in the extreme large differences between one s self perception and one s actual behaviour are a hallmark of several disorders that have important implications for understanding treatment seeking and compliance overconfidence supports delusional thinking such as frequently occurs in individuals with schizophrenia whether a person in making a decision seeks out additional sources of information depends on their level of self confidence specific to that area as the complexity of a decision increases a person is more likely to be influenced by another person and seek out additional information several psychologists suggest that self confident people are more willing to examine evidence that both supports and contradicts their attitudes meanwhile people who are less self confident and more defensive may prefer attitudinal information over information that challenges their perspectives when individuals with low self confidence receive feedback from others they are averse to receiving information about their relative ability and negative informative feedback and not averse to receiving positive feedback if new information about an individual s performance is negative feedback this may interact with a negative affective state low self confidence causing the individual to become demoralized which in turn induces a self defeating attitude that increases the likelihood of failure in the future more than if they did not lack self confidence people may be more self confident about what they believe if they consult sources of information that agree with their world views people may deceive themselves about their positive qualities and the negative qualities of others so that they can display greater self confidence than they might otherwise feel thereby enabling them to advance socially and materially perceptions of self confidence in others people with high self confidence are more likely to impress others as others perceive them as more knowledgeable and more likely to make correct judgments despite this a negative correlation is sometimes found between the level of their self confidence and the accuracy of their claims when people are uncertain and unknowledgeable about a topic they are more likely to believe the testimony and follow the advice of those that seem self confident however expert psychological testimony on the factors that influence eyewitness memory appears to reduce juror reliance on self confidence people prefer leaders with greater self confidence over those with less self confidence self confident leaders tend to influence others through persuasion instead of resorting to coercive means they are more likely to resolve issues by referring them to another qualified person or calling upon bureaucratic procedures which avoid personal involvement others suggest that self confidence does not affect leadership style but is only correlated with years of supervisory experience and self perceptions of power variation in different groups social scientists have discovered that self confidence operates differently in different categories of people children and students in children self confidence emerges differently than in adults for example only children as a group may be more self confident than other children if children are self confident they may be more likely to sacrifice immediate recreational time for possible rewards in the future enhancing their self regulatory capability successful performance of children in music increases feelings of self confidence increasing motivation for study by adolescence youth who have little contact with friends tend to have low self confidence in adolescents low self confidence may be a predictor of loneliness in general students who perform well have increased confidence which likely in turn encourages them to take greater responsibility to complete tasks teachers affect the self confidence of their students depending on how they treat them students who perform better receive more positive evaluation reports and have greater self confidence characteristically low achieving students report less confidence while characteristically high performing students report higher self confidence extracurricular activities in school settings can boost confidence in students at earlier ages these include participation in games or sports visual and performing arts and public speaking in a phenomenon known as stereotype threat african american students perform more poorly on exams relative to white american students if they must reveal their racial identities before the exam a similar phenomenon has been found in female students performance relative to male students on math tests the opposite has been observed in asian americans whose confidence becomes tied up in expectations that they will succeed by both parents and teachers and who claim others perceive them as excelling academically more than they are male university students may be more confident than their female counterparts in regards to inter ethnic interaction and language learning those who engage more with people of different ethnicity and language become more self confident in interacting with them men and women women who are either high or low in general self confidence are more likely to be persuaded to change their opinion than women with medium self confidence however when specific high confidence self efficacy is high generalized confidence plays less of a role men who have low generalized self confidence are more easily persuaded than men of high generalized self confidence women tend to respond less to negative feedback and be more averse to negative feedback than men in experiments conducted by economists muriel niederle and lise vesterlund the researchers found that male overconfidence and male preference for competition contributed to higher male participation in a competitive tournament scheme while risk and feedback aversion played a negligible role some scholars partly attribute the fact of women being less likely to persist in engineering college than men to women s diminished sense of self confidence more self confident women may receive high performance evaluations but not be as well liked as men who engage in the same behaviour confident women may be considered a better job candidate than both men and women who behaved modestly male common stock investors trade 45 more than their female counterparts which they attribute to greater recklessness though also self confidence of men reducing men s net returns by 2 65 percentage points per year versus women s 1 72 percentage points women report lower self confidence levels than men in supervising subordinates one study found that women who viewed commercials with women in traditional gender roles appeared less self confident in giving a speech than those who viewed commercials with women taking on more masculine roles such self confidence may also be related to body image as one study found a sample of overweight people in australia and the us are less self confident about their body s performance than people of average weight and the difference is even greater for women than for men others found that if a newborn is separated from its mother upon delivery the mother is less self confident in her ability to raise that child than one who was not separated from her child furthermore women who initially had low self confidence are likely to experience a larger drop of self confidence after separation from their children than women with relatively higher self confidence heterosexual men who exhibit greater self confidence relative to other men more easily attract single and partnered women athletes self confidence is one of the most influential factors in how well an athlete performs in a competition in particular robust self confidence beliefs are correlated with aspects of mental toughness the ability to cope better than one s opponents and remain focused under pressure these traits enable athletes to bounce back from adversity when athletes confront stress while playing sports their self confidence decreases however feedback from their team members in the form of emotional and informational support reduces the extent to which stresses in sports reduce their self confidence at high levels of support performance related stress does not affect self confidence among gymnasts those who tend to talk to themselves in an instructional format tend to be more self confident than those who do not in a group members desire for success and confidence can also be related groups that had a higher desire for success did better in performance than groups with a weaker desire the more frequently a group succeeded the more interest they had in the activity and success self confidence in different cultures the utility of self confidence may vary by culture some find asians perform

as the opposite of failure the criteria for success depend on context and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system one person might consider a success what another person considers a failure particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero sum game similarly the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants such that a situation that one considers to be a success another might consider to be a failure a qualified success or a neutral situation for example a film that is a commercial failure or even a box office bomb can go on to receive a cult following with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness it may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for success or failure due to ambiguous or ill defined definition of those criteria finding useful and effective criteria or heuristics to judge the failure or success of a situation may itself be a significant task in american culture devitis and rich link the success to the notion of the american dream they observe that t he ideal of success is found in the american dream which is probably the most potent ideology in american life and suggest that americans generally believe in achievement success and materialism weiss in his study of success in the american psyche compares the american view of success with max weber s concept of the protestant work ethic a private opinion survey by the think tank populace found that americans now emphasize secure retirement financial independence parenthood and work fulfillment as their american dream in biology natural selection is the variation in successful survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype it is a key mechanism of evolution the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations charles darwin popularized the term natural selection contrasting it with artificial selection which in his view is intentional whereas natural selection is not as darwin phrased it in 1859 natural selection is the principle by which each slight variation of a trait if useful is preserved the concept was simple but powerful individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce as long as there is some variation between them and that variation is heritable there will be an inevitable selection of individuals with the most advantageous variations if the variations are heritable then differential reproductive success leads to a progressive evolution of particular populations of a species and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually become different species in education a student s success within an educational system is often expressed by way of grading grades may be given as numbers letters or other symbols by the year 1884 mount holyoke college was evaluating students performance on a 100 point or percentage scale and then summarizing those numerical grades by assigning letter grades to numerical ranges mount holyoke assigned letter grades a through e with e indicating lower than 75 performance the a e system spread to harvard university by 1890 in 1898 mount holyoke adjusted the grading system adding an f grade for failing and adjusting the ranges corresponding to the other letters the practice of letter grades spread more broadly in the first decades of the 20th century by the 1930s the letter e was dropped from the system for unclear reasons educational systems themselves can be evaluated on how successfully they impart knowledge and skills for example the programme for international student assessment pisa is a worldwide study by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15 year old school pupils scholastic performance on mathematics science and reading it was first performed in 2000 and then repeated every three years carol dweck a stanford university psychologist primarily researches motivation personality and development as related to implicit theories of intelligence her key contribution to education the 2006 book mindset the new psychology of success dweck s work presents mindset as on a continuum between fixed mindset intelligence is static and growth mindset intelligence can be developed growth mindset is a learning focus that embraces challenge and supports persistence in the face of setbacks as a result of growth mindset individuals have a greater sense of free will and are more likely to continue working toward their idea of success despite setbacks in business and leadership malcolm gladwell s 2008 book outliers the story of success suggests that the notion of the self made man is a myth gladwell argues that the success of entrepreneurs such as bill gates is due to their circumstances as opposed to their inborn talent andrew likierman former dean of london business school argues that success is a relative rather than an absolute term success needs to be measured against stated objectives and against the achievements of relevant peers he suggests jeff bezos amazon and jack ma alibaba have been successful in business because at the time they started there were many companies aspiring to the dominance these two have achieved likierman puts forward four propositions regarding company success and its measurement there is no single definition of a successful company and no single measure of company success profit and share value cannot be taken directly as measures of company success and require careful interpretation judgement is required when interpreting past and present performance company success reflects an interpretation of key factors it is not a fact in philosophy of science scientific theories are often deemed successful when they make predictions that are confirmed by experiment for example calculations regarding the big bang predicted the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of chemical elements in deep space see big bang nucleosynthesis and observations have borne out these predictions scientific theories can also achieve success more indirectly by suggesting other ideas that turn out correct for example johannes kepler conceived a model of the solar system based on the platonic solids although this idea was itself incorrect it motivated him to pursue the work that led to the discoveries now known as kepler s laws which were pivotal in the development of astronomy and physics in probability the fields of probability and statistics often study situations where events are labeled as successes or failures for example a bernoulli trial is a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes success and failure in which the probability of success is the same every time the experiment is conducted the concept is named after jacob bernoulli a 17th century swiss mathematician who analyzed them in his ars conjectandi 1713 the term success in this sense consists in the result meeting specified conditions not in any moral judgement for example the experiment could be the act of rolling a single die with the result of rolling a six being declared a success and all other outcomes grouped together under the designation failure assuming a fair die the probability of success would then be 1 6 displaystyle 1 6 dissatisfaction with success although fame and success are widely sought by many people successful people are often displeased by their status overall there is a general correlation between success and unhappiness a study done in 2008 notes that ceos are depressed at more than double the rate of the public at large suggesting that this is not a phenomenon exclusive to celebrities research suggests that people tend to focus more on objective success ie status wealth reputation as benchmarks for success rather than subjective success ie self worth relationships moral introspection and as a result become disillusioned with the success they do have celebrities in particular face specific circumstances that cause them to be displeased by their success see also critical success factor customer success probability of success propaganda of success success trap survivorship bias victory references sources

or to succeed at lofty goals it has been categorized both as a virtue and as a vice the use of the word ambitious in william shakespeare s julius caesar 1599 for example points to its use to describe someone who is ruthless in seeking out positions of power and influence the noble brutushath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault today however someone may be described as ambitious who has more benevolent aspirations someone who has lofty goals drive initiative tenacity and the pursuit of excellence aristotle encountered the same ambiguity in greek where philotimos \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ambition and aphilotimos \u1f00\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 lack of ambition each had positive or negative connotations depending on the context he was unable to discover a good term that unambiguously described the desirable golden mean for this trait as there is no recognized term for the observance of the mean the extremes fight so to speak for what seems an empty place origin and nature ambition has been interpreted as the resolute culmination of a bold personal decision but also as a receptive acceptance of an externally provided great destiny it can be characterized as a drive or a goad that makes the person with ambition uncomfortable until they have realized their goals this discomfort can in part arise from the fact that the extraordinary goals that characterize ambition tend to come to public notice david hume called it the most incurable and inflexible of human passions philosopher agnes callard contrasts ambition with aspiration in her view ambition concerns goals with already ascertained value money power fame and the like aspiration concerns goals that one does not yet fully understand the value of but that one hopes to understand in the process of reaching for them references", "Utopia": "a utopia yoo toh pee \u0259 typically describes an imagined community or society that possesses highly desirable or near perfect qualities for its members it was coined by sir thomas more for his 1516 book utopia which describes a fictional island society in the new world hypothetical utopias focus on among other things equality in categories such as economics government and justice with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying according to ideology lyman tower sargent argues that the nature of a utopia is inherently contradictory because societies are not homogeneous and have desires which conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied to quote there are socialist capitalist monarchical democratic anarchist ecological feminist patriarchal egalitarian hierarchical racist left wing right wing reformist free love nuclear family extended family gay lesbian and many more utopias naturism nude christians utopianism some argue is essential for the improvement of the human condition but if used wrongly it becomes dangerous utopia has an inherent contradictory nature here the opposite of a utopia is a dystopia utopian and dystopian fiction has become a popular literary category despite being common parlance for something imaginary utopianism inspired and was inspired by some reality based fields and concepts such as architecture file sharing social networks universal basic income communes open borders and even pirate bases etymology and history the word utopia was coined in 1516 from ancient greek by the englishman sir thomas more for his latin text utopia it literally translates as no place coming from the greek \u03bf\u1f50 not and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 place and meant any non existent society when described in considerable detail however in standard usage the word s meaning has shifted and now usually describes a non existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society in his original work more carefully pointed out the similarity of the word to eutopia meaning good place from greek \u03b5\u1f56 good or well and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 place which ostensibly would be the more appropriate term for the concept in modern english the pronunciations of eutopia and utopia in english are identical which may have given rise to the change in meaning dystopia a term meaning bad place coined in 1868 draws on this latter meaning the opposite of a utopia dystopia is a concept which surpassed utopia in popularity in the fictional literature from the 1950s onwards chiefly because of the impact of george orwell s nineteen eighty four in 1876 writer charles renouvier published a novel called uchronia french uchronie the neologism using chronos instead of topos has since been used to refer to non existent idealized times in fiction such as philip roth s the plot against america 2004 and philip k dick s the man in the high castle 1962 according to the philosophical dictionary proto utopian ideas begin as early as the period of ancient greece and rome medieval heretics peasant revolts and establish themselves in the period of the early capitalism reformation and renaissance hus m\u00fcntzer more campanella democratic revolutions meslier morelly mably winstanley later babeufists blanquists and in a period of turbulent development of capitalism that highlighted antagonisms of capitalist society saint simon fourier owen cabet lamennais proudhon and their followers definitions and interpretations famous quotes from writers and characters about utopia there is nothing like a dream to create the future utopia to

wish for something different henri lefebvre every daring attempt to make a great change in existing conditions every lofty vision of new possibilities for the human race has been labeled utopian emma goldman utopian socialist \u00e9tienne cabet in his utopian book the voyage to icaria cited the definition from the contemporary dictionary of ethical and political sciences utopias and other models of government based on the public good may be inconceivable because of the disordered human passions which under the wrong governments seek to highlight the poorly conceived or selfish interest of the community but even though we find it impossible they are ridiculous to sinful people whose sense of self destruction prevents them from believing marx and engels used the word utopia to denote unscientific social theories philosopher slavoj \u017ei\u017eek told about utopia which means that we should reinvent utopia but in what sense there are two false meanings of utopia one is this old notion of imagining this ideal society we know will never be realized the other is the capitalist utopia in the sense of new perverse desire that you are not only allowed but even solicited to realize the true utopia is when the situation is so without issue without the way to resolve it within the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival you have to invent a new space utopia is not kind of a free imagination utopia is a matter of inner most urgency you are forced to imagine it it is the only way out and this is what we need today philosopher milan \u0161ime\u010dka said utopism was a common type of thinking at the dawn of human civilization we find utopian beliefs in the oldest religious imaginations appear regularly in the neighborhood of ancient yet pre philosophical views on the causes and meaning of natural events the purpose of creation the path of good and evil happiness and misfortune fairy tales and legends later inspired by poetry and philosophy the underlying motives on which utopian literature is built are as old as the entire historical epoch of human history philosopher richard stahel said every social organization relies on something that is not realized or feasible but has the ideal that is somewhere beyond the horizon a lighthouse to which it may seek to approach if it considers that ideal socially valid and generally accepted varieties chronologically the first recorded utopian proposal is plato s republic part conversation part fictional depiction and part policy proposal republic would categorize citizens into a rigid class structure of golden silver bronze and iron socioeconomic classes the golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50 year long educational program to be benign oligarchs the philosopher kings plato stressed this structure many times in statements and in his published works such as the republic the wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources though the details on how to do this are unclear the educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal it has few laws no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war but hires mercenaries from among its war prone neighbors these mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out leaving peaceful peoples to remain during the 16th century thomas more s book utopia proposed an ideal society of the same name readers including utopian socialists have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation while others have postulated that thomas more intended nothing of the sort it is believed that more s utopia functions only on the level of a satire a work intended to reveal more about the england of his time than about an idealistic society this interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation and its apparent confusion between the greek for no place and good place utopia is a compound of the syllable ou meaning no and topos meaning place but the homophonic prefix eu meaning good also resonates in the word with the implication that the perfectly good place is really no place mythical and religious utopias in many cultures societies and religions there is some myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state but at the same time one of perfect happiness and fulfillment in those days the various myths tell us there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature people s needs were few and their desires limited both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature accordingly there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression nor was there any need for hard and painful work humans were simple and pious and felt themselves close to their god or gods according to one anthropological theory hunter gatherers were the original affluent society these mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times however in utopias the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places imagining that at some time in the future at some point in space or beyond death there must exist the possibility of living happily in the united states and europe during the second great awakening ca 1790 1840 and thereafter many radical religious groups formed utopian societies in which faith could govern all aspects of members lives these utopian societies included the shakers who originated in england in the 18th century and arrived in america in 1774 a number of religious utopian societies from europe came to the united states in the 18th and 19th centuries including the society of the woman in the wilderness led by johannes kelpius 1667 1708 the ephrata cloister established in 1732 and the harmony society among others the harmony society was a christian theosophy and pietist group founded in iptingen germany in 1785 due to religious persecution by the lutheran church and the government in w\u00fcrttemberg the society moved to the united states on october 7 1803 settling in pennsylvania on february 15 1805 about 400 followers formally organized the harmony society placing all their goods in common the group lasted until 1905 making it one of the longest running financially successful communes in american history the oneida community founded by john humphrey noyes in oneida new york was a utopian religious commune that lasted from 1848 to 1881 although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of oneida silverware it was one of the longest running communes in american history the amana colonies were communal settlements in iowa started by radical german pietists which lasted from 1855 to 1932 the amana corporation manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances was originally started by the group other examples are fountain grove founded in 1875 riker s holy city and other californian utopian colonies between 1855 and 1955 hine as well as sointula in british columbia canada the amish and hutterites can also be considered an attempt towards religious utopia a wide variety of intentional communities with some type of faith based ideas have also started across the world anthropologist richard sosis examined 200 communes in the 19th century united states both religious and secular mostly utopian socialist 39 percent of the religious communes were still functioning 20 years after their founding while only 6 percent of the secular communes were the number of costly sacrifices that a religious commune demanded from its members had a linear effect on its longevity while in secular communes demands for costly sacrifices did not correlate with longevity and the majority of the secular communes failed within 8 years sosis cites anthropologist roy rappaport in arguing that rituals and laws are more effective when sacralized social psychologist jonathan haidt cites sosis s research in his 2012 book the righteous mind as the best evidence that religion is an adaptive solution to the free rider problem by enabling cooperation without kinship evolutionary medicine researcher randolph m nesse and theoretical biologist mary jane west eberhard have argued instead that because humans with altruistic tendencies are preferred as social partners they receive fitness advantages by social selection with nesse arguing further that social selection enabled humans as a species to become extraordinarily cooperative and capable of creating culture the book of revelation in the christian bible depicts an eschatological time with the defeat of satan of evil and of sin the main difference compared to the old testament promises is that such a defeat also has an ontological value then i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and there was no longer any sea he will

mundane details of this new earth where god and jesus rule remain unclear although it is implied to be similar to the biblical garden of eden some theological philosophers believe that heaven will not be a physical realm but instead an incorporeal place for souls golden age the greek poet hesiod around the 8th century bc in his compilation of the mythological tradition the poem works and days explained that prior to the present era there were four other progressively less perfect ones the oldest of which was the golden age scheria perhaps the oldest utopia of which we know as pointed out many years ago by moses finley is homer s scheria island of the phaeacians a mythical place often equated with classical corcyra modern corfu kerkyra where odysseus was washed ashore after 10 years of storm tossed wandering and escorted to the king s palace by his daughter nausicaa with stout walls a stone temple and good harbours it is perhaps the ideal greek colony a model for those founded from the middle of the 8th century onward a land of plenty home to expert mariners with the self navigating ships and skilled craftswomen who live in peace under their king s rule and fear no strangers plutarch the greek historian and biographer of the 1st century dealt with the blissful and mythic past of humanity arcadia from sir philip sidney s prose romance the old arcadia 1580 originally a region in the peloponnesus arcadia became a synonym for any rural area that serves as a pastoral setting a locus amoenus delightful place the biblical garden of eden the biblical garden of eden as depicted in the old testament bible s book of genesis 2 authorized version of 1611 according to the exegesis that the biblical theologian herbert haag proposes in the book is original sin in scripture published soon after the second vatican council genesis 2 25 would indicate that adam and eve were created from the beginning naked of the divine grace an originary grace that then they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated on the other hand while supporting a continuity in the bible about the absence of preternatural gifts latin dona praeternaturalia with regard to the ophitic event haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life the land of cockaigne the land of cockaigne also cockaygne cokaygne was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury famous in medieval stories and the subject of several poems one of which an early translation of a 13th century french work is given in george ellis specimens of early english poets in this the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes the streets were paved with pastry and the shops supplied goods for nothing london has been so called see cockney but boileau applies the same to paris schlaraffenland is an analogous german tradition all these myths also express some hope that the idyllic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind that it can be regained in some way or other one way might be a quest for an earthly paradise a place like shangri la hidden in the tibetan mountains and described by james hilton in his utopian novel lost horizon 1933 christopher columbus followed directly in this tradition in his belief that he had found the garden of eden when towards the end of the 15th century he first encountered the new world and its indigenous inhabitants the peach blossom spring the peach blossom spring chinese \u6843\u82b1\u6e90 pinyin t\u00e1ohu\u0101yu\u00e1n a prose piece written by the chinese poet tao yuanming describes a utopian place the narrative goes that a fisherman from wuling sailed upstream a river and came across a beautiful blossoming peach grove and lush green fields covered with blossom petals entranced by the beauty he continued upstream and stumbled onto a small grotto when he reached the end of the river though narrow at first he was able to squeeze through the passage and discovered an ethereal utopia where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature he saw a vast expanse of fertile lands clear ponds mulberry trees bamboo groves and the like with a community of people of all ages and houses in neat rows the people explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the qin dynasty and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside they had not even heard of the later dynasties of bygone times or the then current jin dynasty in the story the community was secluded and unaffected by the troubles of the outside world the sense of timelessness was predominant in the story as a perfect utopian community remains unchanged that is it had no decline nor the need to improve eventually the chinese term peach blossom spring came to be synonymous for the concept of utopia datong datong chinese \u5927\u540c pinyin d\u00e0t\u00f3ng is a traditional chinese utopia the main description of it is found in the chinese classic of rites in the chapter called li yun chinese \u79ae\u904b pinyin l\u01d0 y\u00f9n later datong and its ideal of the world belongs to everyone the world is held in common tianxia weigong chinese \u5929\u4e0b\u7232\u516c pinyin ti\u0101nxi\u00e0 w\u00e8i g\u014dng influenced modern chinese reformers and revolutionaries such as kang youwei ketumati it is said once maitreya is reborn into the future kingdom of ketumati a utopian age will commence the city is described in buddhism as a domain filled with palaces made of gems and surrounded by kalpavriksha trees producing goods during its years none of the inhabitants of jambudvipa will need to take part in cultivation and hunger will no longer exist modern utopias in the 21st century discussions around utopia for some authors include post scarcity economics late capitalism and universal basic income for example the human capitalism utopia envisioned in utopia for realists rutger bregman 2016 includes a universal basic income and a 15 hour workweek along with open borders scandinavian nations which as of 2019 ranked at the top of the world happiness report are sometimes cited as modern utopias although british author michael booth has called that a myth and wrote a 2014 book about the nordic countries economics particularly in the early 19th century several utopian ideas arose often in response to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of commercialism and capitalism these ideas are often grouped in a greater utopian socialist movement due to their shared characteristics a once common characteristic is an egalitarian distribution of goods frequently with the total abolition of money citizens only do work which they enjoy and which is for the common good leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences one classic example of such a utopia appears in edward bellamy s 1888 novel looking backward william morris depicts another socialist utopia in his 1890 novel news from nowhere written partially in response to the top down bureaucratic nature of bellamy s utopia which morris criticized however as the socialist movement developed it moved away from utopianism marx in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism which he described as utopian for more information see the history of socialism article in a materialist utopian society the economy is perfect there is no inflation and only perfect social and financial equality exists edward gibbon wakefield s utopian theorizing on systematic colonial settlement policy in the early 19th century also centred on economic considerations but with a view to preserving class distinctions wakefield influenced several colonies founded in new zealand and australia in the 1830s 1840s and 1850s in 1905 h g wells published a modern utopia which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion also consider eric frank russell s book the great explosion 1963 the last section of which details an economic and social utopia this forms the first mention of the idea of local exchange trading systems lets during the khrushchev thaw period the soviet writer ivan efremov produced the science fiction utopia andromeda 1957 in which a major cultural thaw took place humanity communicates with a galaxy wide great circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies the english political philosopher james harrington 1611 1677 author of the utopian work the commonwealth of oceana published in 1656 inspired english country party republicanism 1680s to 1740s and became influential in the design of three american colonies his theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the american founders the colonies of carolina founded in 1670 pennsylvania founded in 1681 and georgia founded in 1733 were the only three english colonies in america that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical economic and social design at the heart of the plan for georgia was a concept of agrarian equality in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by thomas jefferson the communes of the 1960s in the united states often represented an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities the back to the land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms or in remote areas and to set up new types of governance communes like kaliflower which existed between 1967 and 1973 attempted to live outside of society s norms and to create their own ideal communalist society people all over the world organized and built intentional communities with the hope of developing a better way of living together many of these intentional communities are relatively small many intentional communities have a population close to 100 with many possibly exceeding this number while this may seem large it is pretty small in comparison to the rest of society from the small populations it is apparent that people do not prefer this kind of living while many of these new small communities failed some continue to grow such as the religion based twelve tribes which started in the united states in 1972 since its inception it has grown into many groups around the world similarly a commune called brook farm established itself in 1841 founded by charles fourier s visions of utopia they attempted to recreate his idea of a central building in society called the phalanx unfortunately this commune could not sustain itself and failed after only six years of operation they wanted to stay open for longer but they could not afford it their goal however was very similar to that of utopia to lead a more wholesome and simpler life than the atmosphere of pressure surrounding society at the time it is clear that despite ambition it is difficult for communes to stay in operation for very long science and technology though francis bacon s new atlantis is imbued with a scientific spirit scientific and technological utopias tend to be based in the future when it is believed that advanced science and technology will allow utopian living standards for example the absence of death and suffering changes in human nature and the human condition technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions like sleep eating or even reproduction have been replaced by artificial means other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition e g star trek in place of the static perfection of a utopia libertarian transhumanists envision an extropia an open evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer mariah utsawa presented a theoretical basis for technological utopianism and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia in his book deep utopia life and meaning in a solved world philosopher nick bostrom explores what to do in a solved world assuming that human civilization safely builds machine superintelligence and manages to solve its political coordination and fairness problems he outlines some technologies considered physically possible at technological maturity such as cognitive enhancement reversal of aging self replicating spacecrafts arbitrary sensory inputs taste sound or the precise control of motivation mood well being and personality one notable example of a technological and libertarian socialist utopia is scottish author iain banks culture opposing this optimistic perspective are scenarios where advanced science and technology will through deliberate misuse or accident cause environmental damage or even humanity s extinction critics such as jacques ellul and timothy mitchell advocate precautions against the premature embrace of new technologies both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by division of labour authors such as john zerzan and derrick jensen consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization in favor of small scale organization as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and sustainability there are many examples of techno dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture such as the classics brave new world and nineteen eighty four often published as 1984 which have explored some of these topics ecological ecological utopian society describes new ways in which society should relate to nature ecotopia the notebooks and reports of william weston from 1975 by ernest callenbach was one of the first influential ecological utopian novels richard grove s book green imperialism colonial expansion tropical island edens and the origins of environmentalism 1600 1860 from 1995 suggested the roots of ecological utopian thinking grove s book sees early environmentalism as a result of the impact of utopian tropical islands on european data driven scientists the works on ecological eutopia perceive a widening gap between the modern western way of living that destroys nature and a more traditional way of living before industrialization ecological utopias may advocate a society that is more sustainable according to the dutch philosopher marius de geus ecological utopias could be inspirational sources for movements involving green politics feminism utopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct or a biologically hard wired imperative or some mix of the two socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the woman question seriously and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision whether this be by addressing misogyny reorganizing society along separatist lines creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender or in some other manner for example edward bellamy s looking backward 1887 responded progressively for his day to the contemporary women s suffrage and women s rights movements bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world s structure albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity due to women s lesser physical strength and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for and to praise motherhood one of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is charlotte perkins gilman s herland 1915 in science fiction and technological speculation gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level marge piercy s woman on the edge of time portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality regardless of the gender of the lovers birth giving often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women s rights and roles has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience when a child is born it spends most of its time in the children s ward with peers three mothers per child are the norm and they are chosen in a gender neutral way men as well as women may become mothers on the basis of their experience and ability technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in shulamith firestone s the dialectic of sex the fictional aliens in mary gentle s golden witchbreed start out as gender neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty and gender has no bearing on social roles in contrast doris lessing s the marriages between zones three four and five 1980 suggests that men s and women s values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed making a compromise between them essential in my own utopia 1961 by elizabeth mann borghese gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex genderless children mature into women some of whom eventually become men william marston s wonder woman comics of the 1940s featured paradise island also known as themyscira a matriarchal all female community of peace loving submission bondage and giant space kangaroos utopian single gender worlds or single sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender differences in speculative fiction female only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female parthenogenic reproduction charlotte perkins gilman s 1915 novel approaches this type of separate society many feminist utopias pondering separatism were written in the 1970s as a response to the lesbian separatist movement examples include joanna russ s the female man and suzy mckee charnas s walk to the end of the world and motherlines utopias imagined by male authors have often included equality between sexes rather than separation although as noted bellamy s strategy includes a certain amount of separate but equal the use of female only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from patriarchy the societies may be lesbian such as daughters of a coral dawn by katherine v forrest or not and may not be sexual at all a famous early sexless example being herland 1915 by charlotte perkins gilman charlene ball writes in women s studies encyclopedia that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the united states compared to europe and elsewhere although such efforts as gerd brantenberg s egalia s daughters and christa wolf s portrayal of the land of colchis in her medea voices are certainly as influential and famous as any of the american feminist utopias urban design walter elias disney s original epcot concept experimental prototype community of tomorrow paolo soleri s arcosanti and saudi prince mohammed bin salman s neom are examples of utopian city design critical utopia critical utopia is a theory conceptualised by literary theorist tom moylan in contrast with utopianism critical utopia rejects utopia the idea is highly self referential and uses the idea of utopia to advance society while critiquing it simultaneously a problem with utopianism is identified it has limitations since the imagined utopia is significantly distant from current society utopia also fails to acknowledge the differences between people that result in differences in experience moylan explains that critical utopias ultimately refer to something other than a predictable alternative paradigm for at their core they identify self critical utopian discourse itself as a process that can tear apart the dominant ideological web here then critical utopian discourse becomes a seditious expression of social change and popular sovereignty carried on in a permanently open process of envisioning what is not yet see

faculty of imagination in the human brain and marked by an expression of certain desires through vivid mental imagery fantasies are generally associated with scenarios that are impossible or unlikely to happen conscious fantasy in everyday life individuals often find their thoughts pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done fantasies of control or of sovereign choice daydreams george eman vaillant in his study of defence mechanisms took as a central example of an immature defence fantasy living in a walter mitty dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job other researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements providing small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect research by deirdre barrett reports that people differ radically in the vividness as well as frequency of fantasy and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art literature or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions freud and fantasy according to sigmund freud a fantasy is constructed around multiple often repressed wishes and employs disguise to mask and mark the very defensive processes by which desire is enacted the subject s desire to maintain distance from the repressed wish and simultaneously experience it opens up a type of third person syntax allowing for multiple entry into the fantasy therefore in fantasy vision is multiplied it becomes possible to see from more than one position at the same time to see oneself and to see oneself seeing oneself to divide vision and dislocate subjectivity this radical omission of the i position creates space for all those processes that depend upon such a center including not only identification but also the field and organization of vision itself for freud sexuality is linked from the very beginning to an object of fantasy however the object to be rediscovered is not the lost object but its substitute by displacement the lost object is the object of self preservation of hunger and the object one seeks to re find in sexuality is an object displaced in relation to that first object this initial scene of fantasy is created out of the frustrated infants deflection away from the instinctual need for milk and nourishment towards a phantasmization of the mothers breast which is in close proximity to the instinctual need now bodily pleasure is derived from the sucking of the mother s breast itself the mouth that was the original source of nourishment is now the mouth that takes pleasure in its own sucking this substitution of the breast for milk and the breast for a phantasmic scene represents a further level of mediation which is increasingly psychic the child cannot experience the pleasure of milk without the psychic re inscription of the scene in the mind the finding of an object is in fact a re finding of it it is in the movement and constant restaging away from the instinct that desire is constituted and mobilized freud and daydreams a similarly positive view of fantasy was taken by sigmund freud who considered fantasy german fantasie a defence mechanism he considered that men and women cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality we simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions as theodor fontane once said without dwelling on imaginary wish fulfillments as childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed so too one species of thought activity was split off it was kept free from reality testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone this activity is fantasying continued as day dreaming he compared such phantasising to the way a nature reserve preserves its original state where everything including what is useless and even what is noxious can grow and proliferate there as it pleases daydreams for freud were thus a valuable resource these day dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious he considered these fantasies to include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of a personality and that the energetic man is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality whereas the artist can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms the doom of neurosis klein and unconscious fantasy melanie klein extended freud s concept of fantasy to cover the developing child s relationship to a world of internal objects in her thought this kind of play activity inside the person is known as unconscious fantasy and these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive they are different from ordinary day dreams or fantasies the term fantasy became a central issue with the development of the kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the british psycho analytical society and was at the heart of the so called controversial discussions of the wartime years a paper by susan isaacs 1952 on the nature and function of phantasy has been generally accepted by the klein group in london as a fundamental statement of their position as a defining feature kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects these are thought of as primary and innate and as the mental representations of instincts the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms isaacs considered that unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life both in normal and neurotic people the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that both in analysis and life we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious fantasy isaacs however claimed that freud s hallucinatory wish fulfilment and his introjection and projection are the basis of the fantasy life and how far unconscious fantasy was a genuine development of freud s ideas how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic paradigm is perhaps the key question of the controversial discussions lacan fantasy and desire lacan engaged from early on with the phantasies revealed by melanie klein the imago of the mother this shadow of the bad internal objects with the imaginary increasingly however it was freud s idea of fantasy as a kind of screen memory representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected that was for him of greater importance lacan came to believe that the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary something determinate in the function of repetition phantasies thus both link to and block off the individual s unconscious his kernel or real core subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split in the resistance of the phantasy which thus comes close to the centre of the individual s personality and its splits and conflicts the subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well developed forms of day dreaming and as a rule a subject s fantasies are close variations on a single theme the fundamental fantasy minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire the goal of therapy thus became la travers\u00e9e du fantasme the crossing over traversal or traversing of the fundamental fantasy for lacan the traversing of fantasy involves the subject s assumption of a new position with respect to the other as language and the other as desire a utopian moment beyond neurosis the question he was left with was what then does he who has passed through the experience who has traversed the radical phantasy become the fantasy principle the postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication here we are told we need to go beyond the pleasure principle the reality principle and repetition compulsion to the fantasy principle not as freud did reduce fantasies to wishes but consider all other imaginable emotions and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating such a perspective sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective typifications narcissistic personality disorder two characteristics of someone with narcissistic personality disorder are a pervasive pattern of grandiosity in fantasy or behavior a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success power brilliance beauty or ideal love schizophrenia fantasy is a common symptom in individuals with schizophrenia they depict specific patterns of high neurological activities in their brains default mode network which possibly

aftermath of world war i in which artists aimed to allow the unconscious mind to express itself often resulting in the depiction of illogical or dreamlike scenes and ideas its intention was according to leader andr\u00e9 breton to resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality a super reality or surreality it produced works of painting writing photography theatre filmmaking music comedy and other media as well works of surrealism feature the element of surprise unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur however many surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost for instance of the pure psychic automatism breton speaks of in the first surrealist manifesto with the works themselves being secondary i e artifacts of surrealist experimentation leader breton was explicit in his assertion that surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement at the time the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism it was influenced by the dada movement of the 1910s the term surrealism originated with guillaume apollinaire in 1917 however the surrealist movement was not officially established until after october 1924 when the surrealist manifesto published by french poet and critic andr\u00e9 breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by yvan goll who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior the most important center of the movement was paris france from the 1920s onward the movement spread around the globe impacting the visual arts literature theatre film and music of many countries and languages as well as political thought and practice philosophy and social and cultural theories founding of the movement the word surrealism was first coined in march 1917 by guillaume apollinaire he wrote in a letter to paul derm\u00e9e all things considered i think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism which i first used tout bien examin\u00e9 je crois en effet qu il vaut mieux adopter surr\u00e9alisme que surnaturalisme que j avais d abord employ\u00e9 apollinaire used the term in his program notes for sergei diaghilev s ballets russes parade which premiered 18 may 1917 parade had a one act scenario by jean cocteau and was performed with music by erik satie cocteau described the ballet as realistic apollinaire went further describing parade as surrealistic this new alliance i say new because until now scenery and costumes were linked only by factitious bonds has given rise in parade to a kind of surrealism which i consider to be the point of departure for a whole series of manifestations of the new spirit that is making itself felt today and that will certainly appeal to our best minds we may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness for it is only natural after all that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress apollinaire 1917 the term was taken up again by apollinaire both as subtitle and in the preface to his play les mamelles de tir\u00e9sias drame surr\u00e9aliste which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917 world war i scattered the writers and artists who had been based in paris and in the interim many became involved with dada believing that excessive rational thought and bourgeois values had brought the conflict of the war upon the world the dadaists protested with anti art gatherings performances writings and art works after the war when they returned to paris the dada activities continued during the war andr\u00e9 breton who had trained in medicine and psychiatry served in a neurological hospital where he used sigmund freud s psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from shell shock meeting the young writer jacques vach\u00e9 breton felt that vach\u00e9 was the spiritual son of writer and pataphysics founder alfred jarry he admired the young writer s anti social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition later breton wrote in literature i was successively taken with rimbaud with jarry with apollinaire with nouveau with lautr\u00e9amont but it is jacques vach\u00e9 to whom i owe the most back in paris breton joined in dada activities and started the literary journal litt\u00e9rature along with louis aragon and philippe soupault they began experimenting with automatic writing spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts and published the writings as well as accounts of dreams in the magazine breton and soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published the magnetic fields 1920 by october 1924 two rival surrealist groups had formed to publish a surrealist manifesto each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by appolinaire one group led by yvan goll consisted of pierre albert birot paul derm\u00e9e c\u00e9line arnauld francis picabia tristan tzara giuseppe ungaretti pierre reverdy marcel arland joseph delteil jean painlev\u00e9 and robert delaunay among others the group led by andr\u00e9 breton claimed that automatism was a better tactic for societal change than those of dada as led by tzara who was now among their rivals breton s group grew to include writers and artists from various media such as paul \u00e9luard benjamin p\u00e9ret ren\u00e9 crevel robert desnos jacques baron max morise pierre naville roger vitrac gala \u00e9luard max ernst salvador dal\u00ed luis bu\u00f1uel man ray hans arp georges malkine michel leiris georges limbour antonin artaud raymond queneau andr\u00e9 masson joan mir\u00f3 marcel duchamp jacques pr\u00e9vert and yves tanguy dora maar as they developed their philosophy they believed that surrealism would advocate the idea that ordinary and depictive expressions are vital and important but that the sense of their arrangement must be open to the full range of imagination according to the hegelian dialectic they also looked to the marxist dialectic and the work of such theorists as walter benjamin and herbert marcuse freud s work with free association dream analysis and the unconscious was of utmost importance to the surrealists in developing methods to liberate imagination they embraced idiosyncrasy while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness as dal\u00ed later proclaimed there is only one difference between a madman and me i am not mad beside the use of dream analysis they emphasized that one could combine inside the same frame elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet pierre reverdy which said a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities the more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true the stronger the image will be the greater its emotional power and poetic reality the group aimed to revolutionize human experience in its personal cultural social and political aspects they wanted to free people from false rationality and restrictive customs and structures breton proclaimed that the true aim of surrealism was long live the social revolution and it alone to this goal at various times surrealists aligned with communism and anarchism in 1924 two surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate surrealist manifestos that same year the bureau of surrealist research was established and began publishing the journal la r\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste surrealist manifestos leading up to 1924 two rival surrealist groups had formed each group claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by apollinaire one group led by yvan goll consisted of pierre albert birot paul derm\u00e9e c\u00e9line arnauld francis picabia tristan tzara giuseppe ungaretti pierre reverdy marcel arland joseph delteil jean painlev\u00e9 and robert delaunay among others the other group led by breton included aragon desnos \u00e9luard baron crevel malkine jacques andr\u00e9 boiffard and jean carrive among others yvan goll published the manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme 1 october 1924 in his first and only issue of surr\u00e9alisme two weeks prior to the release of breton s manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme published by \u00e9ditions du sagittaire 15 october 1924 goll and breton clashed openly at one point literally fighting at the com\u00e9die des champs \u00e9lys\u00e9es over the rights to the term surrealism in the end breton won the battle through tactical and numerical superiority though the quarrel over the anteriority of surrealism concluded with the victory of breton the history of surrealism from that moment would remain marked by fractures resignations and resounding excommunications with each surrealist having their own view of the issue and goals and accepting more or less the definitions laid out by andr\u00e9 breton breton s 1924 surrealist manifesto defines the purposes of surrealism he included citations of the influences on surrealism examples of surrealist works and discussion of surrealist automatism he provided the following definitions dictionary surrealism n pure psychic automatism by which one proposes to express either verbally in writing or by any other manner the real functioning of thought dictation of thought in the absence of all control exercised by reason outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation encyclopedia surrealism philosophy surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations in the omnipotence of dream in the disinterested play of thought it tends to ruin once and for all other psychic mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving all the principal problems of life expansion the movement in the mid 1920s was characterized by meetings in cafes where the surrealists played collaborative drawing games discussed the theories of surrealism and developed a variety of techniques such as automatic drawing breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and automatism this caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as frottage grattage and decalcomania soon more visual artists became involved including giorgio de chirico max ernst joan mir\u00f3 francis picabia yves tanguy salvador dal\u00ed luis bu\u00f1uel alberto giacometti valentine hugo m\u00e9ret oppenheim toyen and kansuke yamamoto later after the second world war enrico donati vinicius pradella and denis fabbri became involved as well though breton admired pablo picasso and marcel duchamp and courted them to join the movement they remained peripheral more writers also joined including former dadaist tristan tzara ren\u00e9 char and georges sadoul in 1925 an autonomous surrealist group formed in brussels the group included the musician poet and artist e l t mesens painter and writer ren\u00e9 magritte paul noug\u00e9 marcel lecomte and andr\u00e9 souris in 1927 they were joined by the writer louis scutenaire they corresponded regularly with the paris group and in 1927 both goemans and magritte moved to paris and frequented breton s circle the artists with their roots in dada and cubism the abstraction of wassily kandinsky expressionism and post impressionism also reached to older bloodlines or proto surrealists such as hieronymus bosch and the so called primitive and naive arts andr\u00e9 masson s automatic drawings of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from dada since they reflect the influence of the idea of the unconscious mind another example is giacometti s 1925 torso which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture however a striking example of the line used to divide dada and surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925 s little machine constructed by minimax dadamax in person von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen with the kiss le baiser from 1927 by max ernst the first is generally held to have a distance and erotic subtext whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly in the second the influence of mir\u00f3 and the drawing style of picasso is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as pop art giorgio de chirico and his previous development of metaphysical art was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of surrealism between 1911 and 1917 he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later the red tower la tour rouge from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by surrealist painters his 1914 the nostalgia of the poet la nostalgie du po\u00e8te has the figure turned away from the viewer and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation he was also a writer whose novel hebdomeros presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation syntax and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images his images including set designs for the ballets russes would create a decorative form of surrealism and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with surrealism in the public mind dal\u00ed and magritte he would however leave the surrealist group in 1928 in 1924 mir\u00f3 and masson applied surrealism to painting the first surrealist exhibition la peinture surrealiste was held at galerie pierre in paris in 1925 it displayed works by masson man ray paul klee mir\u00f3 and others the show confirmed that surrealism had a component in the visual arts though it had been initially debated whether this was possible and techniques from dada such as photomontage were used the following year on march 26 1926 galerie surr\u00e9aliste opened with an exhibition by man ray breton published surrealism and painting in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point though he continued to update the work until the 1960s surrealist literature the first surrealist work according to leader breton was les chants de maldoror and the first work written and published by his group of surr\u00e9alistes was les champs magn\u00e9tiques may june 1919 litt\u00e9rature contained automatist works and accounts of dreams the magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones the poetic undercurrents present not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents but also to the connotations and the overtones which exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images because surrealist writers seldom if ever appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present some people find much of their work difficult to parse this notion however is a superficial comprehension prompted no doubt by breton s initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality but as in breton s case much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very thought out breton himself later admitted that automatic writing s centrality had been overstated and other elements were introduced especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches thus such elements as collage were introduced arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in pierre reverdy s poetry and as in magritte s case where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself surrealism was meant to be always in flux to be more modern than modern and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose artists such as max ernst and his surrealist collages demonstrate this shift to a more modern art form that also comments on society surrealists revived interest in isidore ducasse known by his pseudonym comte de lautr\u00e9amont and for the line beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella and arthur rimbaud two late 19th century writers believed to be the precursors of surrealism examples of surrealist literature are artaud s le p\u00e8se nerfs 1926 aragon s irene s cunt 1927 p\u00e9ret s death to the pigs 1929 crevel s mr knife miss fork 1931 sadegh hedayat s the blind owl 1937 and breton s sur la route de san romano 1948 la r\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text but which also included reproductions of art among them works by de chirico ernst masson and man ray other works included books poems pamphlets automatic texts and theoretical tracts surrealist films early films by surrealists include entr acte by ren\u00e9 clair 1924 the seashell and the clergyman french la coquille et le clergyman by germaine dulac scenario by antonin artaud 1928 l \u00e9toile de mer by man ray 1928 un chien andalou by luis bu\u00f1uel and salvador dal\u00ed 1929 l \u00e2ge d or by bu\u00f1uel and dal\u00ed 1930 the blood of a poet french le sang d un po\u00e8te by jean cocteau 1930 surrealist photography famous surrealist photographers are the french dora maar the american man ray the french hungarian brassa\u00ef french claude cahun and the dutch emiel van moerkerken surrealist theatre the word surrealist was first used by apollinaire to describe his 1917 play les mamelles de tir\u00e9sias the breasts of tiresias which was later adapted into an opera by francis poulenc roger vitrac s the mysteries of love 1927 and victor or the children take over 1928 are often considered the best examples of surrealist theatre despite his expulsion from the movement in 1926 the plays were staged at the theatre alfred jarry the theatre vitrac co founded with antonin artaud another early surrealist who was expelled from the movement following his collaboration with vitrac artaud would extend surrealist thought through his theory of the theatre of cruelty artaud rejected the majority of western theatre as a perversion of its original intent which he felt should be a mystical metaphysical experience instead he envisioned a theatre that would be immediate and direct linking the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event artaud created in which emotions feelings and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically creating a mythological archetypal allegorical vision closely related to the world of dreams the spanish playwright and director federico garc\u00eda lorca also experimented with surrealism particularly in his plays the public 1930 when five years pass 1931 and play without a title 1935 other surrealist plays include aragon s backs to the wall 1925 gertrude stein s opera doctor faustus lights the lights 1938 has also been described as american surrealism though it is also related to a theatrical form of cubism surrealist music in the 1920s several composers were influenced by surrealism or by individuals in the surrealist movement among them were bohuslav martin\u016f andr\u00e9 souris erik satie francis poulenc and edgard var\u00e8se who stated that his work arcana was drawn from a dream sequence souris in particular was associated with the movement he had a long relationship with magritte and worked on paul noug\u00e9 s publication adieu marie music by composers from across the twentieth century have been associated with surrealist principles including pierre boulez gy\u00f6rgy ligeti mauricio kagel olivier messiaen and thomas ad\u00e8s germaine tailleferre of the french group les six wrote several works which could be considered to be inspired by surrealism including the 1948 ballet paris magie scenario by lise deharme the operas la petite sir\u00e8ne book by philippe soupault and le ma\u00eetre book by eug\u00e8ne ionesco tailleferre also wrote popular songs to texts by claude marci the wife of henri jeanson whose portrait had been painted by magritte in the 1930s even though breton by 1946 responded rather negatively to the subject of music with his essay silence is golden later surrealists such as paul garon have been interested in and found parallels to surrealism in the improvisation of jazz and the blues jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest for example the 1976 world surrealist exhibition included performances by david honeyboy edwards surrealism and international politics surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices in other places on political practices and in other places still surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics during the 1930s the surrealist idea spread from europe to north america south america founding of the mandr\u00e1gora group in chile in 1938 central america the caribbean and throughout asia as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change politically surrealism was trotskyist communist or anarchist the split from dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists with the surrealists as communist breton and his comrades supported leon trotsky and his international left opposition for a while though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after world war ii some surrealists such as benjamin p\u00e9ret mary low and juan bre\u00e1 aligned with forms of left communism when the dutch surrealist photographer emiel van moerkerken came to breton he did not want to sign the manifesto because he was not a trotskyist for breton being a communist was not enough breton denied van moerkerken s pictures for a publication afterwards this caused a split in surrealism others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies like wolfgang paalen who after trotsky s assassination in mexico prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter surrealist art magazine dyn and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists dal\u00ed supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of francisco franco but cannot be said to represent a trend in surrealism in this respect in fact he was considered by breton and his associates to have betrayed and left surrealism benjamin p\u00e9ret mary low juan bre\u00e1 and spanish native eugenio fern\u00e1ndez granell joined the poum during the spanish civil war breton s followers along with the communist party were working for the liberation of man however breton s group refused to prioritize the proletarian struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both many individuals closely associated with breton notably aragon left his group to work more closely with the communists surrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities in the declaration of january 27 1925 for example members of the paris based bureau of surrealist research including breton aragon and artaud as well as some two dozen others declared their affinity for revolutionary politics while this was initially a somewhat vague formulation by the 1930s many surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism the foremost document of this tendency within surrealism is the manifesto for a free revolutionary art published under the names of breton and diego rivera but actually co authored by breton and leon trotsky however in 1933 the surrealists assertion that a proletarian literature within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the association des ecrivains et artistes r\u00e9volutionnaires and the expulsion of breton \u00e9luard and crevel from the communist party in 1925 the paris surrealist group and the extreme left of the french communist party came together to support abd el krim leader of the rif uprising against french colonialism in morocco in an open letter to writer and french ambassador to japan paul claudel the paris group announced we surrealists pronounced ourselves in favour of changing the imperialist war in its chronic and colonial form into a civil war thus we placed our energies at the disposal of the revolution of the proletariat and its struggles and defined our attitude towards the colonial problem and hence towards the colour question the anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of murderous humanitarianism 1932 which was drafted mainly by crevel signed by breton \u00e9luard p\u00e9ret tanguy and the martiniquan surrealists pierre yoyotte and j m monnerot perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called black surrealism although it is the contact between aim\u00e9 c\u00e9saire and breton in the 1940s in martinique that really lead to the communication of what is known as black surrealism anticolonial revolutionary writers in the n\u00e9gritude movement of martinique a french colony at the time took up surrealism as a revolutionary method a critique of european culture and a radical subjective this linked with other surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of surrealism as a revolutionary praxis the journal tropiques featuring the work of c\u00e9saire along with suzanne c\u00e9saire ren\u00e9 m\u00e9nil lucie th\u00e9s\u00e9e aristide maug\u00e9e and others was first published in 1941 in 1938 andr\u00e9 breton traveled with his wife the painter jacqueline lamba to mexico to meet trotsky staying as the guest of diego rivera s former wife guadalupe marin and there he met frida kahlo and saw her paintings for the first time breton declared kahlo to be an innate surrealist painter internal politics in 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal le grand jeu including roger gilbert lecomte maurice henry and the czech painter josef sima was ostracized also in february breton asked surrealists to assess their degree of moral competence and theoretical refinements included in the second manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action a list which included leiris limbour morise baron queneau pr\u00e9vert desnos masson and boiffard excluded members launched a counterattack sharply criticizing breton in the pamphlet un cadavre which featured a picture of breton wearing a crown of thorns the pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening breton to anatole france whose unquestioned value breton had challenged in 1924 the disunion of 1929 30 and the effects of un cadavre had very little negative impact upon surrealism as breton saw it since core figures such as aragon crevel dal\u00ed and bu\u00f1uel remained true to the idea of group action at least for the time being the success or the controversy of dal\u00ed and bu\u00f1uel s film l age d or in december 1930 had a regenerative effect drawing a number of new recruits and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s disgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical documents edited by georges bataille whose anti idealist materialism formed a hybrid surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans to the dismay of many documents fizzled out in 1931 just as surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam there were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion such as between breton and bataille while aragon left the group after committing himself to the french communist party in 1932 more members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions both political and personal while others left in pursuit of their own style by the end of world war ii the surrealist group led by andr\u00e9 breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism in 1952 breton wrote it was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself breton was consistent in his support for the francophone anarchist federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the platformists supporting fontenis transformed the fa into the f\u00e9d\u00e9ration communiste libertaire he was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the fcl during the algerian war when the fcl suffered severe repression and was forced underground he sheltered fontenis whilst he was in hiding he refused to take sides on the splits in the french anarchist movement and both he and peret expressed solidarity as well with the new f\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the antifascist committees of the 60s alongside the fa golden age throughout the 1930s surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large a surrealist group developed in london and according to breton their 1936 london international surrealist exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions another english surrealist group developed in birmingham meanwhile and was distinguished by its opposition to the london surrealists and preferences for surrealism s french heartland the two groups would reconcile later in the decade dal\u00ed and magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929 and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935 surrealism as a visual movement had found a method to expose psychological truth stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization in order to evoke empathy from the viewer 1931 was a year when several surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution magritte s voice of space la voix des airs is an example of this process where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape another surrealist landscape from this same year is yves tanguy s promontory palace palais promontoire with its molten forms and liquid shapes liquid shapes became the trademark of dal\u00ed particularly in his the persistence of memory which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting the characteristics of this style a combination of the depictive the abstract and the psychological came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the modern period combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche to be made whole with one s individuality between 1930 and 1933 the surrealist group in paris issued the periodical le surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution as the successor of la r\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste from 1936 through 1938 wolfgang paalen gordon onslow ford and roberto matta joined the group paalen contributed fumage and onslow ford coulage as new pictorial automatic techniques long after personal political and professional tensions fragmented the surrealist group magritte and dal\u00ed continued to define a visual program in the arts this program reached beyond painting to encompass photography as well as can be seen from a man ray self portrait whose use of assemblage influenced robert rauschenberg s collage boxes during the 1930s peggy guggenheim an important american art collector married max ernst and began promoting work by other surrealists such as yves tanguy and the british artist john tunnard major exhibitions in the 1930s 1936 london international surrealist exhibition is organised in london by the art historian herbert read with an introduction by andr\u00e9 breton 1936 museum of modern art in new york shows the exhibition fantastic art dada and surrealism 1938 a new exposition internationale du surr\u00e9alisme was held at the beaux arts gallery paris with more than 60 artists from different countries and showed around 300 paintings objects collages photographs and installations the surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on marcel duchamp wolfgang paalen man ray and others to do so at the exhibition s entrance salvador dal\u00ed placed his rainy taxi an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows and a shark headed creature in the driver s seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress surrealist street filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists paalen and duchamp designed the main hall to seem like cave with 1 200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud the patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art on the floor wolfgang paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air much to the surrealists satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers world war ii and the post war period world war ii created havoc not only for the general population of europe but especially for the european artists and writers that opposed fascism and nazism many important artists fled to north america and relative safety in the united states the art community in new york city in particular was already grappling with surrealist ideas and several artists like arshile gorky jackson pollock and robert motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves albeit with some suspicion and reservations ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced by the second world war the taste of the american avant garde in new york swung decisively towards abstract expressionism with the support of key taste makers including peggy guggenheim leo steinberg and clement greenberg however it should not be easily forgotten that abstract expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of american particularly new york artists with european surrealists self exiled during world war ii in particular gorky and paalen influenced the development of this american art form which as surrealism did celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well spring of creativity the early work of many abstract expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements and the emergence at a later date of aspects of dadaistic humor in such artists as rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection up until the emergence of pop art surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in american arts and even in pop some of the humor manifested in surrealism can be found often turned to a cultural criticism the second world war overshadowed for a time almost all intellectual and artistic production in 1939 wolfgang paalen was the first to leave paris for the new world as exile after a long trip through the forests of british columbia he settled in mexico and founded his influential art magazine dyn in 1940 yves tanguy married american surrealist painter kay sage in 1941 breton went to the united states where he co founded the short lived magazine vvv with max ernst marcel duchamp and the american artist david hare however it was the american poet charles henri ford and his magazine view which offered breton a channel for promoting surrealism in the united states the view special issue on duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of surrealism in america it stressed his connections to surrealist methods offered interpretations of his work by breton as well as breton s view that duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements such as futurism and cubism to surrealism wolfgang paalen left the group in 1942 due to political philosophical differences with breton though the war proved disruptive for surrealism the works continued many surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies including magritte many members of the surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet while dal\u00ed may have been excommunicated by breton he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s including references to the persistence of time in a later painting nor did he become a depictive pompier his classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray and some such as andr\u00e9 thirion argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement when the war reached ireland with the belfast blitz in may 1941 colin middleton who had experimented with surrealist themes in the 1930s responded with a series of dark works reflecting the shocked state of the people of the city these were exhibited at the belfast municipal gallery and museum after its restoration in 1943 following near destruction in the blitz during the 1940s surrealism s influence was also felt in england america and the netherlands where gertrude pape and her husband theo van baaren helped to popularize it in their publication the clean handkerchief mark rothko took an interest in biomorphic figures and in england henry moore lucian freud francis bacon and paul nash used or experimented with surrealist techniques however conroy maddox one of the first british surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935 remained within the movement and organized an exhibition of current surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent surrealism maddox s exhibition titled surrealism unlimited was held in paris and attracted international attention he held his last one man show in 2002 and died three years later magritte s work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects while maintaining the element of juxtaposition such as in 1951 s personal values les valeurs personnelles and 1954 s empire of light l empire des lumi\u00e8res magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary such as castle in the pyrenees le ch\u00e2teau des pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es which refers back to voix from 1931 in its suspension over a landscape other figures from the surrealist movement were expelled several of these artists like roberto matta by his own description remained close to surrealism frida kahlo should be mentioned she had a new york solo exhibition in 1938 with 25 paintings encouraged by breton himself after the crushing of the hungarian revolution of 1956 endre rozsda returned to paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism the preface to his first exhibition in the furstenberg gallery 1957 was written by breton yet many new artists explicitly took up the surrealist banner dorothea tanning and louise bourgeois continued to work for example with tanning s rainy day canape from 1970 duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman viewable only through a peephole breton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind as with the publication the tower of light in 1952 breton s return to france after the war began a new phase of surrealist activity in paris and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience breton insisted that surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind major exhibitions of the 1940s 50s and 60s 1942 first papers of surrealism new york the surrealists again called on duchamp to design an exhibition this time he wove a 3 dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works he made a secret arrangement with an associate s son to bring his friends to the opening of the show so that when the finely dressed patrons arrived they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls and skipping rope his design for the show s catalog included found rather than posed photographs of the artists 1947 international surrealist exhibition galerie maeght paris 1959 international surrealist exhibition paris 1960 surrealist intrusion in the enchanters domain new york post breton surrealism in the 1960s the artists and writers associated with the situationist international were closely associated with surrealism while guy debord was critical of and distanced himself from surrealism others such as asger jorn were explicitly using surrealist techniques and methods the events of may 1968 in france included a number of surrealist ideas and among the slogans the students spray painted on the walls of the sorbonne were familiar surrealist ones joan mir\u00f3 would commemorate this in a painting titled may 1968 there were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to surrealism such as the revolutionary surrealist group during the 1980s behind the iron curtain surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the orange alternative the orange alternative was created in 1981 by waldemar fydrych alias major a graduate of history and art history at the university of wroc\u0142aw they used surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large scale happenings organized in the major polish cities during the jaruzelski regime and painted surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti regime slogans major himself was the author of a manifesto of socialist surrealism in this manifesto he stated that the socialist communist system had become so surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself surrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons the guggenheim museum in new york city held an exhibit two private eyes in 1999 and in 2001 tate modern held an exhibition of surrealist art that attracted over 170 000 visitors in 2002 the met in new york city held a show desire unbound and the centre georges pompidou in paris a show called la r\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste surrealist groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day with groups such as the chicago surrealist group the leeds surrealist group and the surrealist group of stockholm jan

influences while surrealism is typically associated with the arts it has impacted many other fields in this sense surrealism does not specifically refer only to self identified surrealists or those sanctioned by breton rather it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination in addition to surrealist theory being grounded in the ideas of hegel marx and freud to its advocates its inherent dynamic is dialectical thought surrealist artists have also cited the alchemists dante hieronymus bosch the marquis de sade charles fourier comte de lautr\u00e9amont and arthur rimbaud as influences may 68 surrealists believe that non western cultures also provide a continued source of inspiration for surrealist activity because some may induce a better balance between instrumental reason and imagination in flight than western culture surrealism has had an identifiable impact on radical and revolutionary politics both directly as in some surrealists joining or allying themselves with radical political groups movements and parties and indirectly through the way in which surrealists emphasize the intimate link between freeing imagination and the mind and liberation from repressive and archaic social structures this was especially visible in the new left of the 1960s and 1970s and the french revolt of may 1968 whose slogan all power to the imagination quoted by the situationists and enrag\u00e9s from the originally marxist r\u00eav\u00e9 lutionary theory and praxis of breton s french surrealist group postmodernism and popular culture many significant literary movements in the later half of the 20th century were directly or indirectly influenced by surrealism this period is known as the postmodern era though there is no widely agreed upon central definition of postmodernism many themes and techniques commonly identified as postmodern are nearly identical to surrealism first papers of surrealism presented the fathers of surrealism in an exhibition that represented the leading monumental step of the avant gardes towards installation art many writers from and associated with the beat generation were influenced greatly by surrealists philip lamantia and ted joans are often categorized as both beat and surrealist writers many other beat writers show significant evidence of surrealist influence a few examples include bob kaufman gregory corso allen ginsberg and lawrence ferlinghetti artaud in particular was very influential to many of the beats but especially ginsberg and carl solomon ginsberg cites artaud s van gogh the man suicided by society as a direct influence on howl along with apollinaire s zone garc\u00eda lorca s ode to walt whitman and schwitters priimiititiii the structure of breton s free union had a significant influence on ginsberg s kaddish in paris ginsberg and corso met their heroes tristan tzara marcel duchamp man ray and benjamin p\u00e9ret and to show their admiration ginsberg kissed duchamp s feet and corso cut off duchamp s tie william s burroughs a core member of the beat generation and a postmodern novelist developed the cut up technique with former surrealist brion gysin in which chance is used to dictate the composition of a text from words cut out of other sources referring to it as the surrealist lark and recognizing its debt to the techniques of tristan tzara postmodern novelist thomas pynchon who was also influenced by beat fiction experimented since the 1960s with the surrealist idea of startling juxtapositions commenting on the necessity of managing this procedure with some degree of care and skill he added that any old combination of details will not do spike jones jr whose father s orchestral recordings had a deep and indelible effect on me as a child said once in an interview one of the things that people don t realize about dad s kind of music is when you replace a c sharp with a gunshot it has to be a c sharp gunshot or it sounds awful many other postmodern fiction writers have been directly influenced by surrealism paul auster for example has translated surrealist poetry and said the surrealists were a real discovery for him salman rushdie when called a magical realist said he saw his work instead allied to surrealism david lynch regarded as a surrealist filmmaker being quoted david lynch has once again risen to the spotlight as a champion of surrealism in regard to his show twin peaks for the work of other postmodernists such as donald barthelme and robert coover a broad comparison to surrealism is common magic realism a popular technique among novelists of the latter half of the 20th century especially among latin american writers has some obvious similarities to surrealism with its juxtaposition of the normal and the dream like as in the work of gabriel garc\u00eda m\u00e1rquez carlos fuentes was inspired by the revolutionary voice in surrealist poetry and points to inspiration breton and artaud found in fuentes homeland mexico though surrealism was a direct influence on magic realism in its early stages many magic realist writers and critics such as amaryll chanady and s p ganguly while acknowledging the similarities cite the many differences obscured by the direct comparison of magic realism and surrealism such as an interest in psychology and the artefacts of european culture they claim is not present in magic realism a prominent example of a magic realist writer who points to surrealism as an early influence is alejo carpentier who also later criticized surrealism s delineation between real and unreal as not representing the true south american experience surrealist groups surrealist individuals and groups have carried on with surrealism after the death of andr\u00e9 breton in 1966 the original paris surrealist group was disbanded by member jean schuster in 1969 but another parisian surrealist group was later formed the current surrealist group of paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal alcheringa the group of czech slovak surrealists never disbanded and continue to publish their journal analogon which now spans almost 100 volumes surrealism and the theatre surrealist theatre and artaud s theatre of cruelty were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic martin esslin called the theatre of the absurd in his 1963 book of the same name though not an organized movement esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the surrealists eug\u00e8ne ionesco in particular was fond of surrealism claiming at one point that breton was one of the most important thinkers in history samuel beckett was also fond of surrealists even translating much of the poetry into english other notable playwrights whom esslin groups under the term for example arthur adamov and fernando arrabal were at some point members of the surrealist group alice farley is an american born artist who became active during the 1970s in san francisco after training in dance at the california institute of the arts farley uses vivid and elaborate costuming that she describes as the vehicles of transformation capable of making a character s thoughts visible often collaborating with musicians such as henry threadgill farley explores the role of improvisation in dance bringing in an automatic aspect to the productions farley has performed in a number of surrealist collaborations including the world surrealist exhibition in chicago in 1976 alleged precursors in older art various much older artists are sometimes claimed as precursors of surrealism foremost among these are hieronymus bosch and giuseppe arcimboldo whom dal\u00ed called the father of surrealism apart from their followers other artists who may be mentioned in this context include joos de momper for some anthropomorphic landscapes many critics feel

in a society for scholars this is very different from the vernacular usage of the term myth that refers to a belief that is not true instead the veracity of a myth is not a defining criterion myths are often endorsed by religious when they are closely linked to religion or spirituality and secular authorities many societies group their myths legends and history together considering myths and legends to be factual accounts of their remote past in particular creation myths take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form origin myths explain how a society s customs institutions and taboos were established and sanctified national myths are narratives about a nation s past that symbolize the nation s values there is a complex relationship between recital of myths and the enactment of rituals etymology the word myth comes from ancient greek \u03bc\u1fe6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 m\u0233thos meaning speech narrative or fiction in turn ancient greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 mytholog\u00eda story legends or story telling combines the word m\u0233thos with the suffix \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 logia study accordingly plato used mytholog\u00eda as a general term for fiction or story telling of any kind this word began was adapted into other european languages in the early 19th century in a much narrower sense as a scholarly term for a traditional story especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining a natural or social phenomenon and typically involving supernatural beings or events the greek term mytholog\u00eda was then borrowed into late latin occurring in the title of latin author fabius planciades fulgentius 5th century mythologi\u00e6 to denote what is now referred to as classical mythology i e greco roman etiological stories involving their gods fulgentius s mythologi\u00e6 explicitly treated its subject matter as allegories requiring interpretation and not as true events the latin term was then adopted in middle french as mythologie whether from french or latin usage english adopted the word mythology in the 15th century initially meaning the exposition of a myth or myths the interpretation of fables or a book of such expositions the word is first attested in john lydgate s troy book c 1425 from lydgate until the 17th or 18th century mythology meant a moral fable allegory or a parable or collection of traditional stories understood to be false it came eventually to be applied to similar bodies of traditional stories among other polytheistic cultures around the world thus mythology entered the english language before myth johnson s dictionary for example has an entry for mythology but not for myth indeed the greek loanword mythos pl mythoi and latinate mythus pl mythi both appeared in english before the first example of myth in 1830 protagonists and structure the main characters in myths are usually non humans such as gods demigods and other supernatural figures others include humans animals or combinations in their classification of myth stories of everyday humans although often of leaders of some type are usually contained in legends as opposed to myths myths are sometimes distinguished from legends in that myths deal with gods usually have no historical basis and are set in a world of the remote past very different from that of the present definitions myth definitions of myth vary to some extent among scholars though finnish folklorist lauri honko offers a widely cited definition myth a story of the gods a religious account of the beginning of the world the creation fundamental events the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order which still obtains a myth expresses and confirms society s religious values and norms it provides a pattern of behavior to be imitated testifies to the efficacy of ritual with its practical ends and establishes the sanctity of cult another definition of myth comes from myth criticism theorist and professor jos\u00e9 manuel losada according to cultural myth criticism the studies of myth must explain and understand myth from inside that is only as a myth losada defines myth as a functional symbolic and thematic narrative of one or several extraordinary events with a transcendent sacred and supernatural referent that lacks in principle historical testimony and that refers to an individual or collective but always absolute cosmogony or eschatology according to the hylistic myth research by assyriologist annette zgoll and classic philologist christian zgoll a myth can be defined as an erz\u00e4hlstoff narrative material which is polymorphic through its variants and depending on the variant polystratic an erz\u00e4hlstoff in which transcending interpretations of what can be experienced are combined into a hyleme sequence with an implicit claim to relevance for the interpretation and mastering of the human condition scholars in other fields use the term myth in varied ways in a broad sense the word can refer to any traditional story popular misconception urban legend or imaginary entity though myth and other folklore genres may overlap myth is often thought to differ from genres such as legend and folktale in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives some kinds of folktales such as fairy stories are not considered true by anyone and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason main characters in myths are usually gods demigods or supernatural humans while legends generally feature humans as their main characters many exceptions and combinations exist as in the iliad odyssey and aeneid moreover as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change myths can come to be considered folktales their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as giants elves and faeries conversely historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time for example the matter of britain the legendary history of great britain especially those focused on king arthur and the knights of the round table and the matter of france seem distantly to originate in historical events of the 5th and 8th centuries respectively and became mythologised over the following centuries in colloquial use myth can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact or any false story this usage which is often pejorative arose from labelling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect but it has spread to cover non religious beliefs as well as commonly used by folklorists and academics in other relevant fields such as anthropology myth has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise among biblical scholars of both the old and new testament the word myth has a technical meaning in that it usually refers to describe the actions of the other worldly in terms of this world such as the creation and the fall since myth is popularly used to describe stories that are not objectively true the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly controversial many religious adherents believe that the narratives told in their respective religious traditions are historical without question and so object to their identification as myths while labelling traditional narratives from other religions as such hence some scholars may label all religious narratives as myths for practical reasons such as to avoid depreciating any one tradition because cultures interpret each other differently relative to one another other scholars may abstain from using the term myth altogether for purposes of avoiding placing pejorative overtones on sacred narratives related terms mythology in present use mythology usually refers to the collection of myths of a group of people for example greek mythology roman mythology celtic mythology and hittite mythology all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures mythology can also refer to the study of myths and mythologies mythography the compilation or description of myths is sometimes known as mythography a term also used for a scholarly anthology of myths or of the study of myths generally key mythographers in the classical tradition include ovid 43 bce 17 18 ce whose tellings of myths have been profoundly influential fabius planciades fulgentius a latin writer of the late 5th to early 6th centuries whose mythologies latin mitologiarum libri iii gathered and gave moralistic interpretations of a wide range of myths the anonymous medieval vatican mythographers who developed anthologies of classical myths that remained influential to the end of the middle ages and renaissance scholar natalis comes whose ten book mythologiae became a standard source for classical mythology in later renaissance europe other prominent mythographies include the thirteenth century prose edda attributed to the icelander snorri sturluson which is the main surviving survey of norse mythology from the middle ages jeffrey g snodgrass professor of anthropology at the colorado state university has termed india s bhats as mythographers myth criticism myth criticism is a system of anthropological interpretation of culture created by french philosopher gilbert durand scholars have used myth criticism to explain the mythical roots of contemporary fiction which means that modern myth criticism needs to be interdisciplinary professor losada offers his own methodologic hermeneutic and epistemological approach to myth while assuming mythopoetical perspectives losada s cultural myth criticism takes a step further incorporating the study of the transcendent dimension its function its disappearance to evaluate the role of myth as a mirror of contemporary culture cultural myth criticism cultural myth criticism without abandoning the analysis of the symbolic invades all cultural manifestations and delves into the difficulties in understanding myth today this cultural myth criticism studies mythical manifestations in fields as wide as literature film and television theater sculpture painting video games music dancing the internet and other artistic fields myth criticism a discipline that studies myths mythology contains them like a pantheon its statues is by nature interdisciplinary it combines the contributions of literary theory the history of literature the fine arts and the new ways of dissemination in the age of communication likewise it undertakes its object of study from its interrelation with other human and social sciences in particular sociology anthropology and economics the need for an approach for a methodology that allows us to understand the complexity of the myth and its manifestations in contemporary times is justified mythos because myth is sometimes used in a pejorative sense some scholars have opted for mythos instead mythos now more commonly refers to its aristotelian sense as a plot point or to a body of interconnected myths or stories especially those belonging to a particular religious or cultural tradition it is sometimes used specifically for modern fictional mythologies such as the world building of h p lovecraft mythopoeia mythopoeia mytho poeia i make myth was termed by j r r tolkien amongst others to refer to the conscious generation of mythology it was notoriously also suggested separately by nazi ideologist alfred rosenberg interpretations comparative mythology comparative mythology is a systematic comparison of myths from different cultures it seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures in some cases comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source this source may inspire myths or provide a common protomythology that diverged into the mythologies of each culture functionalism a number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour eliade argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior and that myths may provide a religious experience by telling or reenacting myths members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present returning to the mythical age thereby coming closer to the divine honko asserted that in some cases a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age for example it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present similarly barthes argued that modern culture explores religious experience since it is not the job of science to define human morality a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past which is in contrast with the technological present pattanaik defines mythology as the subjective truth of people communicated through stories symbols and rituals he says facts are everybody s truth fiction is nobody s truth myths are somebody s truth euhemerism one theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events according to this theory storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods for example the myth of the wind god aeolus may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds herodotus fifth century bce and prodicus made claims of this kind this theory is named euhemerism after mythologist euhemerus c 320 bce who suggested that greek gods developed from legends about humans allegory some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena apollo represents the sun poseidon represents water and so on according to another theory myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts athena represents wise judgment aphrodite romantic desire and so on m\u00fcller supported an allegorical theory of myth he believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally for example a poetic description of the sea as raging was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god personification some thinkers claimed that myths result from the personification of objects and forces according to these thinkers the ancients worshiped natural phenomena such as fire and air gradually deifying them for example according to this theory ancients tended to view things as gods not as mere objects thus they described natural events as acts of personal gods giving rise to myths ritualism according to the myth ritual theory myth is tied to ritual in its most extreme form this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals this claim was first put forward by smith who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth forgetting the original reason for a ritual they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth james george frazer author of the golden bough a book on the comparative study of mythology and religion argued that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals later they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods academic discipline history historically important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of vico schelling schiller jung freud l\u00e9vy bruhl l\u00e9vi strauss frye the soviet school and the myth and ritual school ancient greece the critical interpretation of myth began with the presocratics euhemerus was one of the most important pre modern mythologists he interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events though distorted over many retellings sallustius divided myths into five categories theological physical or concerning natural law animistic or concerning soul material and mixed which concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations plato condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the republic his critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally nevertheless he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings as platonism developed in the phases commonly called middle platonism and neoplatonism writers such as plutarch porphyry proclus olympiodorus and damascius wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and orphic myths mythological themes were consciously employed in literature beginning with homer the resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths cupid and psyche medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature euhemerism as stated earlier refers to the rationalization of myths putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts an example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift notably the re interpretation of pagan mythology following christianization european renaissance interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the renaissance with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century among them the theologia mythologica 1532 19th century the first modern western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the 19th century at the same time as myth was adopted as a scholarly term in european languages they were driven partly by a new interest in europe s ancient past and vernacular culture associated with romantic nationalism and epitomised by the research of jacob grimm 1785 1863 this movement drew european scholars attention not only to classical myths but also material now associated with norse mythology finnish mythology and so forth western theories were also partly driven by europeans efforts to comprehend and control the cultures stories and religions they were encountering through colonialism these encounters included both extremely old texts such as the sanskrit rigveda and the sumerian epic of gilgamesh and current oral narratives such as mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the americas or stories told in traditional african religions the intellectual context for nineteenth century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about evolution these ideas included the recognition that many eurasian languages and therefore conceivably stories were all descended from a lost common ancestor the indo european language which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages they also included the idea that cultures might evolve in ways comparable to species in general 19th century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a unilineal framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling at different speeds along a linear path of cultural development nature one of the dominant mythological theories of the latter 19th century was nature mythology the foremost exponents of which included max m\u00fcller and edward burnett tylor this theory posited that primitive man was primarily concerned with the natural world it tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful to european victorians such as tales about sex incest or cannibalism as metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility unable to conceive impersonal natural laws early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects thus giving rise to animism according to tylor human thought evolved through stages starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas m\u00fcller also saw myth as originating from language even calling myth a disease of language he speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages anthropomorphic figures of speech necessary in such languages were eventually taken literally leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious or divine not all scholars not even all 19th century scholars accepted this view lucien l\u00e9vy bruhl claimed that the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind and not a stage in its historical development recent scholarship noting the fundamental lack of evidence for nature mythology interpretations among people who actually circulated myths has likewise abandoned the key ideas of nature mythology ritual frazer saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law this idea was central to the myth and ritual school of thought according to frazer humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws when they realize applications of these laws do not work they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature thus giving rise to religious myths meanwhile humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events finally humans come to realize nature follows natural laws and they discover their true nature through science here again science makes myth obsolete as humans progress from magic through religion to science segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth 20th century the earlier 20th century saw major work developing psychoanalytical approaches to interpreting myth led by sigmund freud who drawing inspiration from classical myth began developing the concept of the oedipus complex in his 1899 the interpretation of dreams jung likewise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces which he called archetypes he believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes the mid 20th century saw the influential development of a structuralist theory of mythology led by l\u00e9vi strauss strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures specifically pairs of opposites good evil compassionate callous rather than unconscious feelings or urges meanwhile bronislaw malinowski developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world he is associated with the idea that myths such as origin stories might provide a mythic charter a legitimisation for cultural norms and social institutions thus following the structuralist era c 1960s 1980s the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied interpreted and analyzed like ideology history and culture in other words myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that are connected to power political structures and political and economic interests these approaches contrast with approaches such as those of joseph campbell and eliade which hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics in particular myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual real accurate and truth while myth is the opposite in the 1950s barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book mythologies which stood as an early work in the emerging post structuralist approach to mythology which recognised myths existence in the modern world and in popular culture the 20th century saw rapid secularization in western culture this made western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the abrahamic religions as myths theologians such as rudolf bultmann argued that a modern christianity needed to demythologize and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance this in his appendix to myths dreams and mysteries and in the myth of the eternal return eliade attributed modern humans anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred the christian theologian conrad hyers wrote m yth today has come to have negative connotations which are the complete opposite of its meaning in a religious context in a religious context myths are storied vehicles of supreme truth the most basic and important truths of all by them people regulate and interpret their lives and find worth and purpose in their existence myths put one in touch with sacred realities the fundamental sources of being power and truth they are seen not only as being the opposite of error but also as being clearly distinguishable from stories told for entertainment and from the workaday domestic practical language of a people they provide answers to the mysteries of being and becoming mysteries which as mysteries are hidden yet mysteries which are revealed through story and ritual myths deal not only with truth but with ultimate truth 21st century both in 19th century research which tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths and in 20th century structuralist work which sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths from the late 20th century researchers influenced by postmodernism tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form myths are inherently plastic and variable there is consequently no such thing as the original version or original form of a myth one prominent example of this movement was a k ramanujan s essay three hundred ramayanas correspondingly scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology arguing that other media such as the visual arts or even landscape and place naming could be as or more important myths are not texts but narrative materials erz\u00e4hlstoffe that can be adapted in various media such as epics hymns handbooks movies dances etc in contrast to other academic approaches which primarily focus on the social function of myths hylistic myth research aims to understand myths and their nature out of themselves as part of the g\u00f6ttingen myth research annette and christian zgoll developed the method of hylistics narrative material research to extract mythical materials from their media and make possible a transmedial comparison the content of the medium is broken down into the smallest possible plot components hylemes which are listed in standardized form so called hyleme analysis inconsistencies in content can indicate stratification i e the overlapping of several materials narrative variants and edition layers within the same medial concretion to a certain extent this can also be used to reconstruct earlier and alternative variants of the same material that were in competition and or were combined with each other the juxtaposition of hyleme sequences enables the systematic comparison of different variants of the same material or several different materials that are related or structurally similar to each other in his overall presentation of the hundred year history of myth research the classical philologist and myth researcher udo reinhardt mentions christian zgoll s basic work tractatus mythologicus as the latest handbook on myth theory with outstanding significance for modern myth research modernity scholars in the field of cultural studies research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media various mythic elements appear in popular culture as well as television cinema and video games although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film in jungian psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society s goals fears ambitions and dreams the basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives the walt disney company is well known among cultural study scholars for reinventing traditional childhood myths while few films are as obvious as disney fairy tales the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths mythological archetypes such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology battles between gods and creation stories are often the subject of major film productions these films are often created under the guise of cyberpunk action films fantasy dramas and apocalyptic tales 21st century films such as clash of the titans immortals and thor continue the trend of using traditional mythology to frame modern plots authors use mythology as a basis for their books such as rick riordan whose percy jackson and the olympians series is situated in a modern day world where the greek deities are manifest scholars particularly those within the field of fan studies and fans of popular culture have also noted a connection between fan fiction and myth ika willis identified three models of this fan fiction as a reclaiming of popular stories from corporations myth as a means of critiquing or dismantling hegemonic power and myth as a commons of story and a universal story world willis supports the third model a universal story world and argues that fanfiction can be seen as mythic due to its hyperseriality a term invented by sarah iles johnston to describe a hyperconnected universe in which characters and stories are interwoven in an interview for the new york times henry jenkins stated that fanfiction is a way of the culture repairing the damage done in a system where contemporary myths are owned by corporations instead of owned by the folk see also list of mythologies list of mythological objects list of mythology books and sources magic and mythology mythopoeia artificially constructed

fiction often shortened to sci fi or abbreviated sf is a genre of speculative fiction which typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology space exploration time travel parallel universes and extraterrestrial life it can explore science and technology in different ways such as human responses to theoretical new advancements or the consequences thereof science fiction is related to fantasy horror and superhero fiction and contains many subgenres its exact definition has long been disputed among authors critics scholars and readers subgenres include hard science fiction which emphasizes scientific accuracy and soft science fiction focusing on social sciences other notable subgenres are cyberpunk which explores the interface between technology and society and climate fiction addressing environmental issues precedents for science fiction are argued to exist as far back as antiquity but the modern genre primarily arose in the 19th and early 20th centuries when popular writers began looking to technological progress and speculation mary shelley s frankenstein written in 1818 is often credited as the first true science fiction novel jules verne and h g wells are pivotal figures in the genre s development in the 20th century expanded with the introduction of space operas dystopian literature pulp magazines and the golden age of science fiction science fiction has come to influence not just literature but film tv and culture at large besides providing entertainment it can also criticize present day society and explore alternatives and inspire a sense of wonder definitions according to isaac asimov science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology robert a heinlein wrote that a handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read realistic speculation about possible future events based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world past and present and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method american science fiction author and editor lester del rey wrote even the devoted aficionado or fan has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is and the lack of a full satisfactory definition is because there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction another definition comes from the literature book by dk and is scenarios that are at the time of writing technologically impossible extrapolating from present day science or that deal with some form of speculative science based conceit such as a society on earth or another planet that has developed in wholly different ways from our own there is a tendency among science fiction enthusiasts as their own arbiter in deciding what exactly constitutes science fiction david seed says it may be more useful to talk about science fiction as the intersection of other more concrete subgenres damon knight summed up the difficulty saying science fiction is what we point to when we say it alternative terms forrest j ackerman has been credited with first using the term sci fi analogous to the then trendy hi fi in about 1954 the first known use in print was a description of donovan s brain by movie critic jesse zunser in january 1954 as science fiction entered popular culture writers and fans active in the field came to associate the term with low budget low tech b movies and with low quality pulp science fiction by the 1970s critics within the field such as damon knight and terry carr were using sci fi to distinguish hack work from serious science fiction peter nicholls writes that sf or sf is the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers robert heinlein found even science fiction insufficient for certain types of works in this genre and suggested the term speculative fiction to be used instead for those that are more serious or thoughtful history some scholars assert that science fiction had its beginnings in ancient times when the line between myth and fact was blurred written in the 2nd century ce by the satirist lucian a true story contains many themes and tropes characteristic of modern science fiction including travel to other worlds extraterrestrial lifeforms interplanetary warfare and artificial life some

called the father of science fiction following the 17th century development of the novel as a literary form mary shelley s frankenstein 1818 and the last man 1826 helped define the form of the science

amazon prime video social influence science fiction s rapid rise in popularity during the first half of the 20th century was closely tied to the popular respect paid to science at that time as well as the rapid pace of technological innovation and new inventions science fiction has often predicted scientific and technological progress some works predict that new inventions and progress will tend to improve life and society for instance the stories of arthur c clarke and star trek others such as h g wells s the time machine and aldous huxley s brave new world warn about possible negative consequences in 2001 the national science foundation conducted a survey on public attitudes and public understanding science fiction and pseudoscience it found that people who read or prefer science fiction may think about or relate to science differently than other people they also tend to support the space program and the idea of contacting extraterrestrial civilizations carl sagan wrote many

landing of a spacecraft science fiction can act as a vehicle to analyze and recognize a society s past present and potential future social relationships with the other science fiction offers a medium and representation of alterity and differences in social identity brian aldiss described science fiction as cultural wallpaper this widespread influence can be found in trends for writers to employ science fiction as a tool for advocacy and generating cultural insights as well as for educators when teaching across a range of academic disciplines not limited to the natural sciences scholar and science fiction critic george edgar slusser said that science fiction is the one real international literary form we have today and as such has branched out to visual media interactive media and on to whatever new media the world will invent in the 21st century crossover issues between the sciences and the humanities are crucial for the century to come as protest literature science fiction has sometimes been used as a means of social protest george orwell s nineteen eighty four 1949 is an important work of dystopian science fiction it is often invoked in protests against governments and leaders who are seen as totalitarian james cameron s 2009 film avatar was intended as a protest against imperialism and specifically the european colonization of the americas science fiction in latin america and spain explore the concept of authoritarianism robots artificial humans human clones intelligent computers and their possible conflicts with human society have all been major themes of science fiction since at least the publication of shelly s frankenstein some critics have seen this as reflecting authors concerns over the social alienation seen in modern society feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the inequitable political or personal power of one gender over others some works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue climate fiction or cli fi deals with issues concerning climate change and global warming university courses on literature and environmental issues may include climate change fiction in their syllabi and it is often discussed by other media outside of science fiction fandom libertarian science fiction focuses on the politics and social order implied by right libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and private property and in some cases anti statism robert a heinlein is one of the most popular authors of this subgenre including the moon is a harsh mistress and stranger in a strange land science fiction comedy often satirizes and criticizes present day society and sometimes makes fun of the conventions and clich\u00e9s of more serious science fiction sense of wonder science fiction is often said to inspire a sense of wonder science fiction editor publisher and critic david hartwell wrote science fiction s appeal lies in combination of the rational the believable with the miraculous it is an appeal to the sense of wonder carl sagan said one of the great benefits of science fiction is that it can convey bits and pieces hints and phrases of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader works you ponder over as the water is running out of the bathtub or as you walk through the woods in an early winter snowfall in 1967 isaac asimov commented on the changes then occurring in the science fiction community and because today s real life so resembles day before yesterday s fantasy the old time fans are restless deep within whether they admit it or not is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain they feel the loss of a sense of wonder because what was once truly confined to wonder has now become prosaic and mundane science fiction studies the science fiction studies is the critical assessment interpretation and discussion of science fiction literature film tv shows new media fandom and fan fiction science fiction scholars study science fiction to better understand it and its relationship to science technology politics other genres and culture at large science fiction studies began around the turn of the 20th century but it was not until later that science fiction studies solidified as a discipline with the publication of the academic journals extrapolation 1959 foundation the international review of science fiction 1972 and science fiction studies 1973 and the establishment of the oldest organizations devoted to the study of science fiction in 1970 the science fiction research association and the science fiction foundation the field has grown considerably since the 1970s with the establishment of more journals organizations and conferences as well as science fiction degree granting programs such as those offered by the university of liverpool classification science fiction has historically been sub divided between hard science fiction and soft science fiction with the division centering on the feasibility of the science however this distinction has come under increasing scrutiny in the 21st century some authors such as tade thompson and jeff vandermeer have pointed out that stories that focus explicitly on physics astronomy mathematics and engineering tend to be considered hard science fiction while stories that focus on botany mycology zoology and the social sciences tend to be categorized as soft regardless of the relative rigor of the science max gladstone defined hard science fiction as stories where the math works but pointed out that this ends up with stories that often seem weirdly dated as scientific paradigms shift over time michael swanwick dismissed the traditional definition of hard sf altogether instead saying that it was defined by characters striving to solve problems in the right way with determination a touch of stoicism and the consciousness that the universe is not on his or her side ursula k le guin also criticized the more traditional view on the difference between hard and soft sf the hard science fiction writers dismiss everything except well physics astronomy and maybe chemistry biology sociology anthropology that s not science to them that s soft stuff they re not that interested in what human beings do really but i am i draw on the social sciences a great deal literary merit many critics remain skeptical of the literary value of science fiction and other forms of genre fiction though some accepted authors have written works argued by opponents to constitute science fiction mary shelley wrote a number of scientific romance novels in the gothic literature tradition including frankenstein or the modern prometheus 1818 kurt vonnegut was a highly respected american author whose works have been argued by some to contain science fiction premises or themes other science fiction authors whose works are widely considered to be serious literature include ray bradbury including especially fahrenheit 451 1953 and the martian chronicles 1951 arthur c clarke especially for childhood s end and paul myron anthony linebarger writing under the name cordwainer smith doris lessing who was later awarded the nobel prize in literature wrote a series of five sf novels canopus in argos archives 1979 1983 which depict the efforts of more advanced species and civilizations to influence those less advanced including humans on earth david barnett has pointed out that there are books such as the road 2006 by cormac mccarthy cloud atlas 2004 by david mitchell the gone away world 2008 by nick harkaway the stone gods 2007 by jeanette winterson and oryx and crake 2003 by margaret atwood which use recognizable science fiction tropes but which are not classified by their authors and publishers as science fiction atwood in particular argued against the categorization of works like the handmaid s tale as science fiction labeling it oryx and the testaments as speculative fiction and deriding science fiction as talking squids in outer space in his book the western canon literary critic harold bloom includes brave new world stanis\u0142aw lem s solaris kurt vonnegut s cat s cradle and the left hand of darkness as culturally and aesthetically significant works of western literature though lem actively spurned the western label of science fiction in her 1976 essay science fiction and mrs brown ursula k le guin was asked can a science fiction writer write a novel she answered i believe that all novels deal with character the great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character otherwise they would not be novelists but poets historians or pamphleteers orson scott card best known for his 1985 science fiction novel ender s game has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work are contained within the story itself and therefore does not require accepted literary devices and techniques he instead characterized as gimmicks or literary games jonathan lethem in a 1998 essay in the village voice entitled close encounters the squandered promise of science fiction suggested that the point in 1973 when thomas pynchon s gravity s rainbow was nominated for the nebula award and was passed over in favor of clarke s rendezvous with rama stands as a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that sf was about to merge with the mainstream in the same year science fiction author and physicist gregory benford wrote sf is perhaps the defining genre of the twentieth century although its conquering armies are still camped outside the rome of the literary citadels community authors science fiction has

conventions conventions in fandom often shortened as cons such as comic con are held in cities around the world catering to a local regional national or international membership general interest conventions cover all aspects of science fiction while others focus on a particular interest like media fandom filking and others most science fiction conventions are organized by volunteers in non profit groups though most media oriented events are organized by commercial promoters fandom and fanzines science fiction fandom emerged from the letters column in amazing stories magazine soon fans began writing letters to each other and then grouping their comments together in informal publications that became known as fanzines once in regular contact fans wanted to meet each other and organized local clubs in the 1930s the first science fiction conventions gathered fans from a wider area the earliest organized online fandom was the sf lovers community originally a mailing list in the late 1970s with a text archive file that was updated regularly in the 1980s usenet groups greatly expanded the circle of fans online in the 1990s the development of the world wide web increased the community of online fandom by of websites devoted to science fiction and related genres for all media the first science fiction fanzine the comet was published in 1930 by the science

an association such as a classmate neighbor coworker or colleague in some cultures the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships in others such as the u s and canada a person could have many friends and perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people who may be called good friends or best friends other colloquial terms include besties or best friends forever bffs although there are many forms of friendship certain features are common to many such bonds such as choosing to be with one another enjoying time spent together and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another sometimes friends are distinguished from family as in the saying friends and family and sometimes from lovers e g lovers and friends although the line is blurred with friends with benefits similarly being in the friend zone describes someone who is restricted from rising from the status of friend to that of lover see also unrequited love friendship has been studied in academic fields such as communication sociology social psychology anthropology and philosophy various academic theories of friendship have been proposed including social exchange theory equity theory relational dialectics and attachment styles developmental psychology childhood the understanding of friendship by children tends to be focused on areas such as common activities physical proximity and shared expectations 498 such friendships provide an opportunity for playing and practicing self regulation 246 most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend 246 recent work on friendship in young children investigated the cues they use to infer friendship young children use cues such as sharing resources like snacks and sharing secrets especially in older adolescents to determine friendship status when comparing cues of similarity in food preference or gender propinquity and loyalty in adolescent children younger children rely on similarity in gender food preferences but more so propinquity to infer friendship while older adolescents rely heavily on propinquity to infer friendship as children mature they become more reliant on others as awareness grows they gain the ability to empathize with their friends and enjoy playing in groups they also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life based on the reports of teachers and mothers 75 of preschool children had at least one friend this figure rose to 78 through the fifth grade as measured by co nomination as friends and 55 had a mutual best friend 247 about 15 of children were found to be chronically friendless reporting periods of at least six months without mutual friends 250 friendships in childhood can assist in the development of certain skills such as building empathy and learning different problem solving techniques coaching from parents can help children make friends eileen kennedy moore describes three key ingredients of children s friendship formation 1 openness 2 similarity and 3 shared fun parents can also help children understand social guidelines they have not learned on their own drawing from research by robert selman and others kennedy moore outlines developmental stages in children s friendship reflecting an increasing capacity to understand others perspectives i want it my way what s in it for me by the rules caring and sharing and friends through thick and thin adolescence in adolescence friendships become more giving sharing frank supportive and spontaneous adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a reciprocal relationship and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggests they may not be able to satisfy these needs particular personal characteristics and dispositions are also features sought by adolescents when choosing whom to begin a friendship with during adolescence friendship relationships are more based on similar morals and values loyalty and shared interests than those of children whose friendships stem from being in the same vicinity and access to playthings 246 a large study of american adolescents determined how their engagement in problematic behavior such as stealing fighting and truancy was related to their friendships findings indicated that adolescents who were less likely to engage in problematic behavior had friends who did well in school participated in school activities avoided drinking and had good mental health the opposite was true of adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends and whether they and their friendship groups fit in at school friendships formed during post secondary education last longer than friendships formed earlier in late adolescence cross racial friendships tend to be uncommon likely due to prejudice and cultural differences adulthood friendship in adulthood provides companionship affection and emotional support and contributes positively to mental well being and improved physical health 426 adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace the workplace can crackle with competition so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues work friendships often take on a transactional feel it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins many adults value the financial well being and security that their job provides more than developing friendships with coworkers a 2023 pew research center survey report that of the people who responded 8 report having no close friends with an additional 7 reporting only 1 close friend 2 000 american adults surveyed had an average of two close friends defined as people they had discussed important matters with in the past six months numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other supportive relationships enhance self esteem older adults older adults report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age even as the overall number of friends tends to decline this satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish activities of daily living as well as a reduced decline in cognitive abilities decreased instances of hospitalization and better outcomes related to rehabilitation 427 the overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity better speech and vision and marital status 53 a decline in the number of friends an individual has as they become older has been explained by carstensen s socioemotional selectivity theory which describes a change in motivation that adults experience when socializing the theory states that an increase in age is characterized by a shift from information gathering to emotional regulation in order to maintain positive emotions older adults restrict their social groups to those with whom they share an emotional bond as one review phrased it research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong close ties to numerous friends as family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen friendships become more important among the elderly friendships can provide links to the larger community serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members 32 33 especially for people who cannot go out as often interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction additionally older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well being forming and maintaining forming and maintaining friendships often requires time and effort friendships are foremost formed by choice typically on the basis that the parties involved admire each other and enjoy commonality and socializing given that friendships provide people with many mental social and health benefits people should want to associate with and form lasting relationships with people who can provide the benefits they need thus people have specific friendship preferences for the types of behaviors and traits that are associated with these benefits recent work on friendship preferences shows that while there is much overlap between men and women for the traits they prefer in close same gender friends e g being prioritized over other friends friends with varied knowledge skills there are some differences women compared to men had greater preference for emotional support emotional disclosure and emotional reassurance while men compared to women had greater preference for friends that offer opportunities for accruing status boosting their reputation and will provide physical aid most people underestimate how much other people like them the liking gap can make it difficult to form friendships according to communications professor jeffery hall most friendships involve tacitly agreed upon expectations in six different areas positive regard the friends genuinely like each other and are not merely pretending to like each other for the purpose of social climbing or some other desired benefit self disclosure the friends feel that they can discuss topics of deep personal significance instrumental aid the friends help each other in practical ways for example a friend might drive another friend to the airport similarity the friends have similar worldviews for example they might have the same culture class religion or life experiences enjoyment the friends believe that it is fun and easy to spend time together agency the friends have valuable information skills or resources that they can share with each other for example a friend with business connections might know when a desirable job will be available or a wealthy friend might pay for an expensive experience not all relationships have the same balance of each area for example women may prefer friendships that emphasize genuine positive regard and deeper self disclosure and men may prefer friendships with a little more agency developmental issues people with certain types of developmental disorders may struggle to make and maintain friendships this is especially true of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd autism spectrum disorders or children with down syndrome dissolution friendships may end this is often the result of natural changes over time as friends grow more distant both physically and emotionally but it can also be the result of a sudden shock such as learning that a friend holds incompatible values some social media influencers provide suggestions using therapy speak to break up with a friend these have been criticized for being impersonal and upsetting partially because they often reduce a conversation to a 30 second soundbite sized announcement social media posts may also encourage confrontations akin to a workplace performance appraisal in which one person tells a friend that they are dissatisfied and threatens to break off the relationship if the friend does not conform to their expectations the end of a friendship is often due to inappropriate expectations on the part of the dissatisfied person and demanding that a friend meet those expectations is incompatible with friendship s voluntary qualities another option would be for the dissatisfied person to look for another friend who can meet the unmet need for example if someone is dissatisfied because a friend does not plan events then that person could find a second friend someone who enjoys planning events instead of rejecting the first friend for not being able to single handedly meet all of their needs the dissolution of a friendship may be taken personally as a rejection disruptions of friendships are associated with increased guilt anger and depression and may be highly stressful events especially in childhood however potential negative effects can be mitigated if the dissolution of a friendship is replaced with another close relationship 248 demographics friends tend to be similar to one another in terms of age gender behavior substance abuse personal disposition and academic performance 248 426 55 56 same sex friendships in general female bonding tends to focus on interpersonal connections and mutual support women tend to be more expressive in their same sex friendships girls report more anxiety jealousy and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships male bonding can be more focused on social status and may discourage the expression of emotional needs men are more likely to define friendships in terms of shared physical experiences boys report higher levels of physical violence related to their friendships 249 50 male male friendships are generally more like alliances while female female friendships are much more attachment based this also means that the end of male male friendships tends to be less emotionally upsetting than that of female female friendships many older men may rely upon a female companion such as a spouse to compensate for their comparative lack of social capital 55 one study found that women in europe and north america were slightly more likely than men to self report having a best friend preference for same sex friendships over cross sex friendships is also called homosociality or gender homophily cross sex friendships cross sex friendships are non intimate friendships between men and women also described as heterosociality or gender heterophily friendships between men and women have little presence in recorded history having only become a widely accepted practice in the 20th century the rate of cross sex friendships relative to same sex friendships varies by country sex segregation can prevent cross sex friendships culture which relationships count as a true friend rather than as an acquaintance or a co worker vary by culture in english speaking cultures it is not unusual for people to include weaker relationships as being friends in other cultures such as the russian and polish cultures only the most significant relationships are considered friends a russian might have one or two friends plus a large number of pals or acquaintances a canadian in similar circumstances might count all of these relationships as being friends in western cultures friendships are often seen as lesser to familial or romantic relationships friendships in ancient greece were more utilitarian than affectionate being based upon obligation and reliance though different classical communities understood friendship in different ways and the greeks held a much broader conception of friendship than modern english speaking cultures do aristotle wrote of there being three kinds of friendships those in recognition of pleasure those in recognition of advantage and those in recognition of virtue when discussing taboos of friendship it was found that chinese respondents found more than their british counterparts in ethnically diverse countries children and adolescents tend to form friendships with others of the same race or ethnicity beginning in preschool and peaking in middle or late childhood 264 evolutionary approach evolutionary approaches to understanding friendship focus primarily on its function in other words what does friendship do for individuals how does it work psychologically and how do these processes affect people s actual behavior within this field there are multiple proposed theories or perspectives about the function of forming friendships and making friends one is the theory of reciprocal altruism which provides an explanation as to why individuals make friends with un related others it argues that friendship allows people to exchange benefits with each other and keep track of these exchanges in order to avoid exchanging benefits with a poor cooperator or someone who will take benefits without giving any in return another perspective likens friendships to insurance investments and argues when deciding to invest into forming a new friendship with another person an individual should be able to discern whether the potential friend will be willing to help them back in the future if the potential friend is in the position to help them in the future and if the friendship is worth continuing or not especially when many other potential friendships can be made these factors will determine whether forming a friendship with someone will be beneficial or injurious another explanation for the function of friendships is called the alliance hypothesis which argues that the function of friendships is to acquire alliances for future conflicts or disputes the alliance hypothesis states that conflicts typically can be won if and only if one side is able to acquire more allies than the competing side all else equal so individuals should be able to increase their odds of winning the conflict if they are able to recruit more alliances to their side choosing your allies can be very important and there exists a variety of methods in deciding allies such as bandwagoning or choosing an ally that is loyal and will come to your aid in the future conflicts thus individuals should form alliances i e friendships with people that ranks themselves higher than other allies friends it is relative rank i e where the self ranks among all other individuals that is the most important contributing factor when deciding who is a loyal ally and friend health studies found that strong social supports improve a person s prospects for good health and longevity conversely loneliness and a lack of social supports are linked to an increased risk of heart disease viral infections and cancer as well as higher mortality rates overall researchers termed friendship networks a behavioral vaccine that boosts both physical and mental health a large body of research links friendship and health but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear most studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time and while there may be a correlation between the two variables friendship and health status researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship such as good friendships improve health theories that attempt to explain this link include that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed that good friends enhance their friends coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health mental health having few or no friends is a common experience among those who are diagnosed with a range of mental disorders and can be used as a telling factor a 2004 study from the american journal of public health observed that lack of friendship plays a role in increasing risk of suicidal ideation among female adolescents while also true for having more friends who are not themselves friends with one another however it is also suggested that no similar effect is observed for males higher friendship quality directly contributes to self esteem self confidence and social development a world happiness database study found that people with close friendships are happier although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness other studies suggested that children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders such as anxiety and depression conversely having few friends is associated with dropping out of school as well as aggression adult crime and loneliness 500 peer rejection is also associated with lower later aspiration in the workforce and participation in social activities while higher levels of friendship were associated with higher adult self esteem 500 01 having more close friends is correlated with improved mental health and cognitive ability however this association stops once around five friends is reached after which having more friends is no longer linked to better mental health and is correlated with lower cognition additionally people with few or many friends had more symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and were less able to learn from their experiences friendship jealousy jealousy is an emotion that is often studied in the context of romantic and sexual relationships however individuals also feel jealous when it comes to potentially losing valued friendships friendship jealousy acts as an alert to the self that a close friends other friends may be a threat to the self s relationship with that close friend which motivates the self to enact behaviors that prevent the close friend from further developing better relationships with their other friends a recent multi study paper found that friendship jealousy is activated by the potential loss of a friend by another person is highly attuned to the feeling or thoughts of being replaced and that the closer or more valued that friendship is the more friendship jealousy someone will feel men and women also tend to express different levels of friendship jealousy depending on the person who is attempting to replace them in the friendship such that women compared to men expressed more jealousy over the potential loss of a best friend to another woman non human friendship friendship is found among animals of higher intelligence such as higher mammals and some birds there is ample comparative animal research on the existence of friendships or the existence of similar forms of relationships in animals the function of these relationships in non human animals appears to primarily be for forming and solidifying alliances for a wide range of fitness and survival reasons across a range of non human animal species alliances are formed for protection competition over reproductive access to receptive mates as means to seek social comfort solidify social bonds and to thwart diseases an expansive meta analysis examining grooming behaviors in 14 different primate species found that grooming behaviors elicit different types of benefit exchanges such as support and aid for future intra species conflicts male bottlenose dolphins use synchronous surfacing to determine membership of other potential male allies while female bottlenose dolphins use gentle contact behaviors i e touching behaviors with other females in response to harassment from males female spotted hyenas whose groups follow a very strict dominance hierarchy form alliances i e coalitionary bonds to move up the dominance hierarchy by usurping a hyena of higher dominance rank feral female horses develop alliances with other female horses to avoid harassment from male horses and these

imagined world or society in which people lead wretched dehumanized fearful lives it is an imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad typically a totalitarian or environmentally degraded one the opposite of utopia the term dystopia comes from the ancient greek dus bad and t\u00f3pos place and is also called a cacotopia or anti utopia while dystopia is commonly seen as the opposite of utopia a concept coined by thomas more in 1516 to describe an ideal society dystopias are often characterized by fear or distress tyrannical governments environmental disaster or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society themes typical of a dystopian society include complete control over the people in a society through the usage of propaganda and police state tactics heavy censoring of information or denial of free thought worshiping an unattainable goal the complete loss of individuality and heavy enforcement of conformity despite certain overlaps dystopian fiction is distinct from post apocalyptic fiction and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations particularly in historical fiction such as a tale of two cities 1859 by charles dickens quo vadis by henryk sienkiewicz and a man for all seasons 1960 by robert bolt stories set in the alternate history timelines like robert harris fatherland 1992 or in the future famous examples set in the future included robert hugh benson s lord of the world 1907 yevgeny zamyatin s we 1920 aldous huxley s brave new world 1932 george orwell s nineteen eighty four 1949 and ray bradbury s fahrenheit 451 1953 dystopian societies appear in many sub genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society environment politics economics religion psychology ethics science or technology some authors use the term to refer to existing societies many of which are or have been totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse dystopias through an exaggerated worst case scenario often make a criticism about a current trend societal norm or political system etymology dustopia the original spelling of dystopia first appeared in lewis henry younge s utopia or apollo s golden days in 1747 additionally dystopia was used as an antonym for utopia by john stuart mill in one of his 1868 parliamentary speeches hansard commons by adding the prefix dys ancient greek \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3 bad to topia reinterpreting the initial u as the prefix eu ancient greek \u03b5\u03c5 good instead of ou ancient greek \u03bf\u1f50 not it was used to denounce the government s irish land policy it is perhaps too complimentary to call them utopians they ought rather to be called dys topians or caco topians what is commonly called utopian is something too good to be practicable but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable decades before the first documented use of the word dystopia was cacotopia kakotopia using ancient greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03ccs bad wicked originally proposed in 1818 by jeremy bentham as a match for utopia or the imagined seat of the best government suppose a cacotopia or the imagined seat of the worst government discovered and described though dystopia became the more popular term cacotopia finds occasional use anthony burgess author of a clockwork orange 1962 said it was a better fit for orwell s nineteen eighty four because it sounds worse than dystopia theory some scholars such as gregory claeys and lyman tower sargent make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias for example claeys and sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes some of these are anti utopias which criticise attempts to implement various concepts of utopia in the most comprehensive treatment of the literary and real expressions of the concept dystopia a natural history claeys offers a historical approach to these definitions here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the french revolution its commonly anti collectivist character is stressed and the addition of other themes the dangers of science and technology of social inequality of corporate dictatorship of nuclear war are also traced a psychological approach is also favored here with the principle of fear being identified with despotic forms of rule carried forward from the history of political thought and group psychology introduced as a means of understanding the relationship between utopia and dystopia andrew norton schwartzbard noted that written many centuries before the concept dystopia existed dante s inferno in fact includes most of the typical characteristics associated with this genre even if placed in a religious framework rather than in the future of the mundane world as modern dystopias tend to be in the same vein vicente angeloti remarked that george orwell s emblematic phrase a boot stamping on a human face forever would aptly describe the situation of the denizens in dante s hell conversely dante s famous inscription abandon all hope ye who enter here would have been equally appropriate if placed at the entrance to orwell s ministry of love and its notorious room 101 society dystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of their creators contemporaneous culture due to this they can be considered a subject of social studies in dystopias citizens may live in a dehumanized state be under constant surveillance or have a fear of the outside world in the film what happened to monday the protagonists identical septuplet sisters risk their lives by taking turns onto the outside world because of a one child policy place in this futuristic dystopian society in a 1967 study frank kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode christopher schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations people distract themselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment in the 2010s there was a surge of popular dystopian young adult literature and blockbuster films some have commented on this trend saying that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism cultural theorist and critic mark fisher identified the phrase as encompassing the theory of capitalist realism the perceived widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it and used the above quote as the title to the opening chapter of his book capitalist realism is there no alternative in the book he also refers to dystopian film such as children of men originally a novel by p d james to illustrate what he describes as the slow cancellation of the future theo james an actor in divergent originally a novel by veronica roth explains that young people in particular have such a fascination with this kind of story it s becoming part of the consciousness you grow up in a world where it s part of the conversation all the time the statistics of our planet warming up the environment is changing the weather is different these are things that are very visceral and very obvious and they make you question the future and how we will survive it s so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably consciously or not are questioning their futures and how the earth will be i certainly do i wonder what kind of world my children s kids will live in the entire substantial sub genre of alternative history works depicting a world in which nazi germany won the second world war can be considered as dystopias so can other works of alternative history in which a historical turning point led to a manifestly repressive world for example the 2004 mockumentary c s a the confederate states of america and ben winters underground airlines in which slavery in the united states continues to the present with electronic slave auctions carried out via the internet and slaves controlled by electronic devices implanted in their spines or keith roberts pavane in which 20th century britain is ruled by a catholic theocracy and the inquisition is actively torturing and burning heretics common themes politics in when the sleeper wakes h g wells depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow george orwell contrasted wells s world to that depicted in jack london s the iron heel where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism which orwell considered more plausible the political principles at the root of fictional utopias or perfect worlds are idealistic in principle and result in positive consequences for the inhabitants the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based while often based on utopian ideals result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one fatal flaw dystopias are often filled with pessimistic views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring ruling with an iron fist dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist or communist regime or dictator these dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a resistance to enact change within their society as is seen in alan moore s v for vendetta dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as we parable of the sower darkness at noon nineteen eighty four brave new world the handmaid s tale the hunger games divergent and fahrenheit 451 and such films as metropolis brazil 1985 battle royale faq frequently asked questions soylent green the purge election year logan s run the running man 1987 and hemet or the landlady don t drink tea an earlier example is jules verne s the begum s millions with its depiction of stahlstadt steel city a vast industrial and mining complex which is totally devoted to the production of ever more powerful and destructive weapons and which is ruled by the dictatorial and totally ruthless prof schultze a militarist and racist who dreams of world conquest and as the first step plots the complete destruction of the nearby ville france a utopian model city constructed and maintained with public health as its government s primary concern economics the economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression there are several archetypes that such societies tend to follow a theme is the dichotomy of planned economies versus free market economies a conflict which is found in such works as ayn rand s anthem and henry kuttner s short story the iron standard another example of this is reflected in norman jewison s 1975 film rollerball 1975 some dystopias such as that of nineteen eighty four feature black markets with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain or the characters may be at the mercy of the state controlled economy kurt vonnegut s player piano depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor virtually all work is menial unsatisfying and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work in tanith lee s don t bite the sun there is no want of any kind only unabashed consumption and hedonism leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society s flaws as in brave new world the state often controls the economy a character reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body cites as a reason that works for everyone else other works feature extensive privatization and corporatism both consequences of capitalism where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions they manipulate infiltrate control bribe are contracted by and function as government this is seen in the novels jennifer government and oryx and crake and the movies alien avatar robocop visioneers idiocracy soylent green wall e and rollerball corporate republics are common in the cyberpunk genre as in neal stephenson s snow crash and philip k dick s do androids dream of electric sheep as well as the film blade runner influenced by and based upon dick s novel class dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working class in the 1931 novel brave new world by aldous huxley a class system is prenatally determined with alphas betas gammas deltas and epsilons with the lower classes having reduced brain function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that exist in the conventional way but which the world government describes as savages in george orwell s nineteen eighty four the dystopian society described within has a tiered class structure with the ruling elite inner party at the top the outer party below them functioning as a type of middle class with minor privileges and the working class proletariatsat the bottom of the hierarchy with few rights yet making up the vast majority of the population in the film elysium the majority of earth s population on the surface lives in poverty with little access to health care and are subject to worker exploitation and police brutality while the wealthy live above the earth in luxury with access to technologies that cure all diseases reverse aging and regenerate body parts written a century earlier the future society depicted in h g wells the time machine had started in a similar way to elysium the workers consigned to living and working in underground tunnels while the wealthy live on a surface made into an enormous beautiful garden but over a long time period the roles were eventually reversed the rich degenerated and became a decadent livestock regularly caught and eaten by the underground cannibal morlocks family some fictional dystopias such as brave new world and fahrenheit 451 have eradicated the family and kept it from re establishing itself as a social institution in brave new world where children are reproduced artificially the concepts of mother and father are considered obscene in some novels such as we the state is hostile to motherhood as a pregnant woman from one state is in revolt religion in dystopias religious groups may play the role of oppressed or oppressor one of the earliest examples is robert hugh benson s lord of the world about a futuristic world where marxists and freemasons led by the antichrist have taken over the world and the only remaining source of dissent is a tiny and persecuted catholic minority in brave new world the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses as symbols of christianity to make them t s as symbols of henry ford s model t in c s lewis s that hideous strength the leaders of the fictional national institute of coordinated experiments a joint venture of academia and government to promote an anti traditionalist social agenda are contemptuous of religion and require initiates to desecrate christian symbols margaret atwood s novel the handmaid s tale takes place in a future united states under a christian based theocratic regime identity in the russian novel we by yevgeny zamyatin first published in 1921 people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names the latter feature also appears in the film thx 1138 in some dystopian works such as kurt vonnegut s harrison bergeron society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality complete conformity and suppression of individuality to the point of acting in unison is also depicted in madeleine l engle s a wrinkle in time violence violence is prevalent in many

games divergent and the purge it is also explained in suzanne berne s essay ground zero where she explains her experience of the aftermath of 11 september 2001 nature fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature as when walks are regarded as dangerously anti social in ray bradbury s fahrenheit 451 as well as within bradbury s short story the pedestrian in that hideous strength science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts in brave new world the lower class is conditioned to be afraid of nature but also to visit the countryside and consume transport and games to promote economic activity lois lowry s the giver shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against human instincts e m forster s the machine stops depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination as angel galdon rodriguez points out this sort of isolation caused by external toxic hazard is later used by hugh howey in his series of dystopias of the silo series excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films such as the matrix robocop wall e april and the extraordinary world and soylent green as well as in videogames like cyberpunk 2077 and half life 2 a few green fictional dystopias do exist such as in michael carson s short story the punishment of luxury and russell hoban s riddley walker the latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war a post nuclear holocaust kent where technology has reduced to the level of the iron age science and technology contrary to the technologically utopian claims which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely but not always on the negative effects caused by new technology technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature jaron lanier a digital pioneer has become a technological dystopian i think it s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility oh it s the computer that did it not me there s no more middle class oh it s not me the computer did it this quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence it also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification technologies harm our interpersonal communication relationships and communities a decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays technologies reinforce hierarchies concentrate knowledge and skills increase surveillance and erode privacy widen inequalities of power and wealth giving up control to machines douglas rushkoff a technological utopian states in his article that the professional designers re mystified the computer so it wasn t so readable anymore users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users new technologies are sometimes regressive worse than previous technologies the unforeseen impacts of technology are negative the most common way is that there s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free but there s another way to look at it which is the technically true way you gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases it s huge but very much like facebook it s selling people back to themselves with translation you re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime the original translators aren t paid for their work you re actually shrinking the economy more efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life by causing stress destroying jobs making us more materialistic in his article prest o change o technological dystopian james gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem it is meant to solve gleick quotes edward tenner a historian of technology that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching new technologies can solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems the remote control example explains this claim as well for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control he also takes social psychologist robert levine s example of indonesians whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances month after month year after year and with nepalese sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives the indonesians and sherpas are perfectly satisfied because of the invention of the remote control it merely created more problems technologies destroy nature harming human health and the environment the need for business replaced community and the story online replaced people as the soul of the net because information was now able to be bought and sold there was

or person philosophers disagree on what can be an object of loyalty as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human being can be the object of loyalty the definition of loyalty in law and political science is the fidelity of an individual to a nation either one s nation of birth or one s declared home nation by oath naturalization historical concepts the encyclop\u00e6dia britannica eleventh edition defines loyalty as allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one s country and also personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family it traces the word loyalty to the 15th century noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service in love or to an oath that one has made the meaning that the britannica gives as primary it attributes to a shift during the 16th century noting that the origin of the word is in the old french loialte that is in turn rooted in the latin lex meaning law one who is loyal in the feudal sense of fealty is one who is lawful as opposed to an outlaw who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful allegiance to a feudal lord hence the 1911 britannica derived its early 20th century primary meaning of loyalty to a monarch loyalty is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in bushido in combination with six other virtues which are righteousness \u7fa9 gi courage \u52c7 y\u016b benevolence \u4ec1 jin respect \u793c rei sincerity \u8aa0 makoto and honour \u540d\u8a89 meiyo it formed the bushido code it is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal in the gospel of matthew jesus states no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and wealth on the other hand the render unto caesar of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties secular and religious without conflict but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to god the latter takes precedence modern concepts josiah royce presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book the philosophy of loyalty according to royce loyalty is a virtue indeed a primary virtue the heart of all the virtues the central duty amongst all the duties royce presents loyalty which he defines at length as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived the short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause royce s view of loyalty was challenged by john ladd professor of philosophy at brown university in the article on loyalty in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy 1967 ladd observed that by that time the subject had received scant attention in philosophical literature this he attributed to odious associations that the subject had with nationalism including nazism and with the metaphysics of idealism which he characterized as obsolete however he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals anthony ralls observes that ladd s article is that encyclopaedia s only article on a virtue ladd asserts that contrary to royce causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal not impersonal or suprapersonal he states that royce s view has the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men the individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into superhuman good ronald f duska the lamont post chair of ethics and the professions at the american college extends ladd s objection saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one s self will to be identified with anything as royce would have it even if one were identifying one s self will with god to be worthy of such loyalty god would have to be the summum bonum the perfect manifestation of good ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal i e a relationship between a lord and vassal parent and child or two good friends duska states that this characterization leads to a problem that ladd overlooks loyalty may certainly be between two persons but it may also be from a person to a group of people examples of this which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty are loyalty by a person to his or her family to a team that he or she is a member or fan of or to his or her country the problem is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved and whether ladd s contention that loyalty is interpersonal not suprapersonal is an adequate description ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives its proper object and its moral value john kleinig professor of philosophy at city university of new york observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from aeschylus through john galsworthy to joseph conrad by psychologists psychiatrists sociologists scholars of religion political economists scholars of business and marketing and most particularly by political theorists who deal with it in terms of loyalty oaths and patriotism as a philosophical concept loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of josiah royce the grand exception in kleinig s words kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards the subject gained attention with philosophers variously relating it to professional ethics whistleblowing friendship and virtue theory additional aspects enumerated by kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects object of loyalty ladd and others including milton r konvitz and marcia w baron disagree about the proper object of loyalty what it is possible to be loyal to ladd considers loyalty to be interpersonal the object of loyalty is always a person in the encyclopaedia of the history of ideas konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles causes ideas ideals religions ideologies nations governments parties leaders families friends regions racial groups and anyone or anything to which one s heart can become attached or devoted 108 baron agrees with ladd inasmuch as loyalty is to certain people or to a group of people not loyalty to an ideal or cause she argues in her monograph the moral status of loyalty that w hen we speak of causes or ideals we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them kleinig agrees with baron noting that a person s earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values causes and ideals he disagrees however with the notion that loyalties are restricted solely to personal attachments considering it incorrect as a matter of logic loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an evolutionary tactic as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs immanuel kant constructed the basis for an ethical law via the concept of duty kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will no other virtue has this status because every other virtue can be used to achieve immoral ends for example the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person the good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle that freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends multiplicity disloyalty and whether loyalty is exclusionary stephen nathanson professor of philosophy at northeastern university states that loyalty can be either exclusionary or non exclusionary and can be single or multiple exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups whereas non exclusionary loyalty does not people may have single loyalties to just one person group or thing or multiple loyalties to multiple objects multiple loyalties can constitute a disloyalty to an object if one of those loyalties is exclusionary excluding one of the others however nathanson observes this is a special case in the general case the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty one can for example be loyal to one s friends or one s family and still without contradiction be loyal to one s religion or profession other dimensions in addition to number and exclusion as just outlined nathanson enumerates five other dimensions that loyalty can vary along basis strength scope legitimacy and attitude basis loyalties may be constructed on the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty such as biological ties or place of birth a notion of natural allegiance propounded by socrates in his political theory alternatively they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom the degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one s parents or relatives one can choose to desert them strength loyalties can range from supreme loyalties that override all other considerations to merely presumptive loyalties that affect one s presumptions providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis blood is thicker than water is an aphorism that explains that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger scope loyalties with limited scope require few actions of the subject loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes require many actions or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty loyalty to one s job for example may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires loyalty to a family member can in contrast have a very broad effect upon one s actions requiring considerable personal sacrifice extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties scope encompasses an element of constraint where two or more loyalties conflict their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty legitimacy this is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties people with one loyalty can hold that another conflicting loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate in the extreme view one that nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples all loyalties bar one s own are considered illegitimate the xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions at the other end of the spectrum past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not according to cases or plain and simple indifference to other people s loyalties is the positive regard of other people s loyalties attitude the subjects of the loyalties have attitudes towards other people note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the subjects of the loyalty whereas legitimacy above concerns the loyalties themselves people may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties with hate and disdain at one end indifference in the middle and concern and positive feeling at the other in relation to other subjects patriotism nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism he states that this is a false equality while patriots exhibit loyalty it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots he provides the example of a mercenary soldier who exhibits loyalty to the people or country that pays him nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot a mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of professionalism or a belief in the sanctity of contracts a patriot in contrast may be motivated by affection concern identification and a willingness to sacrifice nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue a loyal person can in general be relied upon and hence people view loyalty as virtuous nathanson argues that loyalty can however be given to persons or causes that are unworthy moreover loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane thus nathanson argues patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable such loyalties in nathanson s view are erroneously unlimited in their scopes and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality employment the faithless servant doctrine is a doctrine under the laws of a number of states in the united states and most notably new york state law pursuant to which an employee who acts unfaithfully towards his employer must forfeit all of the compensation he received during the period of his disloyalty whistleblowing several scholars including duska discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing wim vandekerckhove of the university of greenwich points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a bidirectional loyalty between employees and their employer previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer but not that an employer need be loyal to employees the ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community which the employer s business practices may be adversely affecting vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways some of which he does not find to be satisfactory duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances the community a position that vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty john corvino associate professor of philosophy at wayne state university takes a different tack arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice not a virtue and that loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good similar to nathanson vandekerckhove calls this argument interesting but too vague in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer s shortcomings vandekerckhove suggests that duska and corvino combine however to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing by clarifying the objects of those loyalties marketing businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers brand loyalty is a consumer s preference for a particular brand and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand so called loyalty programs offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits a similar concept is fan loyalty an allegiance to and abiding interest in a sports team fictional character or fictional series devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons in animals animals as pets may display a sense of loyalty to humans famous cases include greyfriars bobby a skye terrier who attended his master s grave for fourteen years hachik\u014d an akita dog who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his death and foxie the spaniel belonging to charles gough who stayed by her dead master s side for three months on helvellyn in the lake district in 1805 although it is possible that foxie had eaten gough s body in the mahabharata the righteous king yudhishthira appears at the gates of heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death the god indra is prepared to admit him to heaven but refuses to admit the dog so yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog and prepares to turn away from the gates of heaven then the dog is revealed to be the manifestation of dharma the god of righteousness and justice and who turned out to be his deified self yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog the god of righteousness 684 85 yudhishthira is known by the epithet dharmaputra the lord of righteous duty misplaced misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected is betrayed or taken advantage of it can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause social psychology provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way the norm of social commitment directs us to honor our agreements people usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse humanists point out that man inherits the capacity for loyalty but not the use to which he shall put it may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile as he may to what is generous and noble see also filial piety virtue and practice in chinese classics and chinese society at large pietas ancient roman virtue references further reading alford c fred

latin familia is a group of people related either by consanguinity by recognized birth or affinity by marriage or other relationship it forms the basis for social order ideally families offer predictability structure and safety as members mature and learn to participate in the community historically most human societies use family as the primary purpose of attachment nurturance and socialization anthropologists classify most family organizations as matrifocal a mother and her children patrifocal a father and his children conjugal a married couple with children also called the nuclear family avuncular a man his sister and her children or extended in addition to parents spouse and children may include grandparents aunts uncles or cousins the field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history the family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics the word families can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community nationhood and global village social one of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and reproduction of persons biologically and socially this can occur through the sharing of material substances such as food the giving and receiving of care and nurture nurture kinship jural rights and obligations also moral and sentimental ties thus one s experience of one s family shifts over time there are different perspectives of the term family from the perspective of children the family is a family of orientation the family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization from the point of view of the parent s the family is a family of procreation the goal of which is to produce enculturate and socialize children however producing children is not the only function of the family in societies with a sexual division of labor marriage and the resulting relationship between two people it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household c c harris notes that the western conception of a family is ambiguous and confused with the household as revealed in the different contexts in which the word is used olivia harris states this confusion is not accidental but indicative of the familial ideology of capitalist western countries that pass social legislation that insists members of a nuclear family should live together and that those not so related should not live together despite the ideological and legal pressures a large percentage of families do not conform to the ideal nuclear family type size the total fertility rate of women varies from country to country from a high rate of 6 76 children born per woman in niger to a low rate of 0 81 in singapore as of 2015 fertility is below replacement in all eastern european and southern european countries and particularly high in sub saharan african countries in some cultures the mother s preference of family size influences that of the children s through early adulthood a parent s number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that their children will eventually have types although early western cultural anthropologists and sociologists considered family and kinship to be universally associated with relations by blood based on ideas common in their own cultures later research has shown that many societies instead understand family through ideas of living together the sharing of food e g milk kinship and sharing care and nurture sociologists have a special interest in the function and status of family forms in stratified especially capitalist societies according to the work of scholars max weber alan macfarlane steven ozment jack goody and peter laslett the huge transformation that led to modern marriage in western democracies was fueled by the religio cultural value system provided by elements of judaism early christianity roman catholic canon law and the protestant reformation much sociological historical and anthropological research dedicates itself to the understanding of this variation and of changes in the family that form over time levitan claims times have changed it is more acceptable and encouraged for mothers to work and fathers to spend more time at home with the children the way roles are balanced between the parents will help children grow and learn valuable life lessons there is the great importance of communication and equality in families in order to avoid role strain nonetheless the results of steven ruggles assessment of world census data suggest nineteenth century northwest europe and north america did not have exceptionally simple or nuclear family structure multigenerational family historically the most common family type was one in which grandparents parents and children lived together as a single unit for example the household might include the owners of a farm one or more of their adult children the adult child s spouse and the adult child s own children the owners grandchildren members of the extended family are not included in this family group sometimes skipped generation families such as a grandparents living with their grandchildren are included in the us this arrangement declined after world war ii reaching a low point in 1980 when about one out of every eight people in the us lived in a multigenerational family the numbers have risen since then with one in five people in the us living in a multigenerational family as of 2016 the increasing popularity is partly driven by demographic changes and the economic shifts associated with the boomerang generation multigenerational households are less common in canada where about 6 of people living in canada were living in multigenerational families as of 2016 but the proportion of multigenerational households was increasing rapidly driven by increasing numbers of aboriginal families immigrant families and high housing costs in some regions conjugal nuclear family the term nuclear family is commonly used to refer to conjugal families a conjugal family includes only the spouses and unmarried children who are not of age some sociologists distinguish between conjugal families relatively independent of the kindred of the parents and of other families in general and nuclear families which maintain relatively close ties with their kindred other family structures with for example blended parents single parents and domestic partnerships have begun to challenge the normality of the nuclear family single parent family a single parent family consists of one parent together with their children where the parent is either widowed divorced and not remarried or never married the parent may have sole custody of the children or separated parents may have a shared parenting arrangement where the children divide their time possibly equally between two different single parent families or between one single parent family and one blended family as compared to sole custody physical mental and social well being of children may be improved by shared parenting arrangements and by children having greater access to both parents the number of single parent families have been increasing due to the divorce rate climbing drastically during the years 1965 1995 and about half of all children in the united states will live in a single parent family at some point before they reach the age of 18 most single parent families are headed by a mother but the number of single parent families headed by fathers is increasing matrifocal family a matrifocal family consists of a mother and her children generally these children are her biological offspring although adoption of children occurs in nearly every society this kind of family occurs commonly where women have the resources to rear their children by themselves or where men are more mobile than women as a definition a family or domestic group is matrifocal when it is centred on a woman and her children in this case the father s of these children are intermittently present in the life of the group and occupy a secondary place the children s mother is not necessarily the wife of one of the children s fathers the name matrifocal was coined in guiana but it is defined differently in other countries for nayar families the family have the male as the center or the head of the family either the step father father brother rather than the mother extended family the term extended family is also common especially in the united states this term has two distinct meanings it serves as a synonym of consanguineal family consanguine means of the same blood in societies dominated by the conjugal family it refers to kindred an egocentric network of relatives that extends beyond the domestic group who do not belong to the conjugal family these types refer to ideal or normative structures found in particular societies any society will exhibit some variation in the actual composition and conception of families historically extended families were the basic family unit in the catholic culture and countries such as southern europe and latin america and in asian middle eastern and eastern orthodox countries family of choice the term family of choice also sometimes referred to as chosen family or found family is common within the lgbt community veterans individuals who have suffered abuse and those who have no contact with their biological parents it refers to the group of people in an individual s life that satisfies the typical role of family as a support system the term differentiates between the family of origin the biological family or that in which people are raised and those that actively assume that ideal role the family of choice may or may not include some or all of the members of the family of origin this family is not one that follows the normal familial structure like having a father a mother and children this is family as a group of people that rely on each other like a family of origin would this terminology stems from the fact that many lgbt individuals upon coming out face rejection or shame from the families they were raised in the term family of choice is also used by individuals in the 12 step communities who create close knit family ties through the recovery process as a family system families of choice face unique issues without legal safeguards families of choice may struggle when medical educational or governmental institutions fail to recognize their legitimacy if members of the chosen family have been disowned by their family of origin they may experience surrogate grief displacing anger loss or anxious attachment onto their new family blended family the term blended family or stepfamily describes families with mixed parents one or both parents remarried bringing children of the former family into the new family also in sociology particularly in the works of social psychologist michael lamb traditional family refers to a middle class family with a bread winning father and a stay at home mother married to each other and raising their biological children and nontraditional to exceptions to this rule most of the us households are now non traditional under this definition critics of the term traditional family point out that in most cultures and at most times the extended family model has been most common not the nuclear family though it has had a longer tradition in england than in other parts of europe and asia which contributed large numbers of immigrants to the americas the nuclear family became the most common form in the u s in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of communication patterns in families there are a certain set of beliefs within the family that reflect how its members should communicate and interact these family communication patterns arise from two underlying sets of beliefs one being conversation orientation the degree to which the importance of communication is valued and two conformity orientation the degree to which families should emphasize similarities or differences regarding attitudes beliefs and values blended families is complex ranging from stepfamilies to cohabitating families an individual living with guardians who are not married with step or half siblings while it is not too different from stepfamilies cohabiting families pose a prevalent psychological effect on youths some adolescents would be prone to acts of delinquency and experiencing problems in school ranging from a decrease in academic performance to increased problematic behavior it coincides with other researches on the trajectories of stepfamilies where some experienced familyhood but others lacking connection emotional detachment from members within stepfamilies contributes to this uncertainty furthering the tension that these families may establish the transition from an old family to a new family that falls under blended families would also become problematic as the activities that were once performed in the old family may not transfer well within the new family for adolescents monogamous family a monogamous family is based on a legal or social monogamy in this case an individual has only one official partner during their lifetime or at any one time i e serial monogamy this means that a person may not have several different legal spouses at the same time as this is usually prohibited by bigamy laws the act of entering into a marriage with one person while still legally married to another in jurisdictions that require monogamous marriages polygamous family polygamy is a marriage that includes more than two partners when a man is married to more than one wife at a time the relationship is called polygyny and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time it is called polyandry if a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives it can be called polyamory group or conjoint marriage polygyny is a form of plural marriage in which a man is allowed more than one wife in modern countries that permit polygamy polygyny is typically the only form permitted polygyny is practiced primarily but not only in parts of the middle east and africa and is often associated with islam however there are certain conditions in islam that must be met to perform polygyny polyandry is a form of marriage whereby a woman takes two or more husbands at the same time fraternal polyandry where two or more brothers are married to the same wife is a common form of polyandry polyandry was traditionally practiced in areas of the himalayan mountains among tibetans in nepal in parts of china and in parts of northern india polyandry is most common in societies marked by high male mortality or where males will often be apart from the rest of the family for a considerable period of time kinship terminology degrees of kinship a first degree relative is one who shares 50 of your dna through direct inheritance such as a full sibling parent or progeny there is another measure for the degree of relationship which is determined by counting up generations to the first common ancestor and back down to the target individual which is used for various genealogical and legal purposes terminologies in his book systems of consanguinity and affinity of the human family anthropologist lewis henry morgan 1818 1881 performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world although much of his work is now considered dated he argued that kinship terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions for example most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes the difference between a brother and a sister and between generations the difference between a child and a parent moreover he argued kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and marriage although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood morgan made a distinction between kinship systems that use classificatory terminology and those that use descriptive terminology classificatory systems are generally and erroneously understood to be those that class together with a single term relatives who actually do not have the same type of relationship to ego what defines same type of relationship under such definitions seems to be genealogical relationship this is problematic given that any genealogical description no matter how standardized employs words originating in a folk understanding of kinship what morgan s terminology actually differentiates are those classificatory kinship systems that do not distinguish lineal and collateral relationships and those descriptive kinship systems that do morgan a lawyer came to make this distinction in an effort to understand seneca inheritance practices a seneca man s effects were inherited by his sisters children rather than by his own children morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies hawaiian only distinguishes relatives based upon sex and generation sudanese no two relatives share the same term eskimo in addition to distinguishing relatives based upon sex and generation also distinguishes between lineal relatives and collateral relatives iroquois in addition to sex and generation also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation crow a matrilineal system with some features of an iroquois system but with a skewing feature in which generation is frozen for some relatives omaha like a crow system but patrilineal roles most western societies employ eskimo kinship terminology this kinship terminology commonly occurs in societies with strong conjugal where families have a degree of relative mobility typically societies with conjugal families also favor neolocal residence thus upon marriage a person separates from the nuclear family of their childhood family of orientation and forms a new nuclear family family of procreation such systems generally assume that the mother s husband is also the biological father the system uses highly descriptive terms for the nuclear family and progressively more classificatory as the relatives become more and more collateral nuclear family the system emphasizes the nuclear family members of the nuclear family use highly descriptive kinship terms identifying directly only the husband wife mother father son daughter brother and sister all other relatives are grouped together into categories members of the nuclear family may be lineal or collateral kin for whom these are family refer to them in descriptive terms that build on the terms used within the nuclear family or use the nuclear family term directly nuclear family of orientation brother the male child of a parent sister the female child of a parent father a male parent grandfather the father of a parent mother a female parent grandmother the mother of a parent nuclear conjugal family husband a male spouse wife a female spouse son a male child of the subject grandson a child s son daughter a female child of the subject granddaughter a child s daughter nuclear non lineal family spouse husband or wife stepparent a spouse of a parent that is not a biological parent sibling sister or brother half sibling a sibling with whom the subject shares only one biological parent step sibling a child of a parent that is not a biological parent collateral relatives a sibling is a collateral relative with a minimal removal for collateral relatives with one additional removal one generation more distant from a common ancestor on one side more classificatory terms come into play these terms aunt uncle niece and nephew do not build on the terms used within the nuclear family as most are not traditionally members of the household these terms do not traditionally differentiate between a collateral relatives and a person married to a collateral relative both collateral and aggregate collateral relatives with additional removals on each side are cousins this is the most classificatory term and can be distinguished by degrees of collaterality and by generation removal when only the subject has the additional removal the relative is the subject s parents siblings the terms aunt and uncle are used for female and male relatives respectively when only the relative has the additional removal the relative is the subjects siblings child the terms niece and nephew are used for female and male relatives respectively the spouse of a biological aunt or uncle is an aunt or uncle and the nieces and nephews of a spouse are nieces and nephews with further removal by the subject for aunts and uncles and by the relative for nieces and nephews the prefix grand modifies these terms with further removal the prefix becomes great grand adding another great for each additional generation for large numbers of generations a number can be substituted for example fourth great grandson four greats grandson or four times great grandson when the subject and the relative have an additional removal they are cousins a cousin with minimal removal is a first cousin i e the child of the subjects uncle or aunt degrees of collaterality and removals are used to more precisely describe the relationship between cousins the degree is the number of generations subsequent to the common ancestor before a parent of one of the cousins is found while the removal is the difference between the number of generations from each cousin to the common ancestor the difference between the generations the cousins are from cousins of an older generation in other words one s parents first cousins although technically first cousins once removed are often classified with aunts and uncles aggregate relatives english speakers mark relationships by marriage except for wife husband with the tag in law the mother and father of one s spouse become one s mother in law and father in law the wife of one s son becomes one s daughter in law and the husband of one s daughter becomes one s son in law the term sister in law refers to two essentially different relationships either the wife of one s brother or the sister of one s spouse brother in law is the husband of one s sister or the brother of one s spouse the terms half brother and half sister indicate siblings who share only one biological parent the term aunt in law refers to the aunt of one s spouse uncle in law is the uncle of one s spouse cousin in law is the spouse of one s cousin or the cousin of one s spouse the term niece in law refers to the wife of one s nephew nephew in law is the husband of one s niece the grandmother and grandfather of one s spouse become one s grandmother in law and grandfather in law the wife of one s grandson becomes one s granddaughter in law and the husband of one s granddaughter becomes one s grandson in law in indian english a sibling in law who is the spouse of your sibling can be referred to as a co sibling specificity a co sister or co brother types of kinship patrilineal patrilineality also known as the male line or agnatic kinship is a form of kinship system in which an individual s family membership derives from and is traced through his or her father s lineage it generally involves the inheritance of property rights names or titles by persons related through male kin a patriline father line is a person s father and additional ancestors that are traced only through males one s patriline is thus a record of descent from a man in which the individuals in all intervening generations are male in cultural anthropology a patrilineage is a consanguineal male and female kinship group each of whose members is descended from the common ancestor through male forebears matrilineal matrilineality is a form of kinship system in which an individual s family membership derives from and is traced through his or her mother s lineage it may also correlate with a societal system in which each person is identified with their matriline their mother s lineage and which can involve the inheritance of property and titles a matriline is a line of descent from a female ancestor to a descendant in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothers in other words a mother line in a matrilineal descent system an individual is considered to belong to the same descent group as her or his mother this matrilineal descent pattern is in contrast to the more common patrilineal descent pattern bilateral descent bilateral descent is a form of kinship system in which an individual s family membership derives from and is traced through both the paternal and maternal sides the relatives on the mother s side and father s side are equally important for emotional ties or for transfer of property or wealth it is a family arrangement where descent and inheritance are passed equally through both parents families who use this system trace descent through both parents simultaneously and recognize multiple ancestors but unlike with cognatic descent it is not used to form descent groups traditionally this is found among some groups in west africa india australia indonesia melanesia malaysia and polynesia anthropologists believe that a tribal structure based on bilateral descent helps members live in extreme environments because it allows individuals to rely on two sets of families dispersed over a wide area history of theories early scholars of family history applied darwin s biological theory of evolution in their theory of evolution of family systems american anthropologist lewis h morgan published ancient society in 1877 based on his theory of the three stages of human progress from savagery through barbarism to civilization morgan s book was the inspiration for friedrich engels book the origin of the family private property and the state published in 1884 engels expanded morgan s hypothesis that economical factors caused the transformation of primitive community into a class divided society engels theory of resource control and later that of karl marx was used to explain the cause and effect of change in family structure and function the popularity of this theory was largely unmatched until the 1980s when other sociological theories most notably structural functionalism gained acceptance the nuclear family in industrial society contemporary society generally views the family as a haven from the world supplying absolute fulfillment zinn and eitzen discuss the image of the family as haven a place of intimacy love and trust where individuals may escape the competition of dehumanizing forces in modern society during industrialization t he family as a repository of warmth and tenderness embodied by the mother stands in opposition to the competitive and aggressive world of commerce embodied by the father the family s task was to protect against the outside world however zinn and eitzen note the protective image of the family has waned in recent years as the ideals of family fulfillment have taken shape today the family is more compensatory than protective it supplies what is vitally needed but missing in other social arrangements unhappily married couples are at 3 25 times the risk of developing clinical depression the popular wisdom according to zinn and eitzen sees the family structures of the past as superior to those today and families as more stable and happier at a time when they did not have to contend with problems such as illegitimate children and divorce they respond to this saying there is no golden age of the family gleaming at us in the far back historical past desertion by spouses illegitimate children and other conditions that are considered characteristics of modern times existed in the past as well the postmodern family others argue that whether or not one views the family as declining depends on one s definition of family married couples have dropped below half of all american households this drop is shocking from traditional forms of the family system only a fifth of households were following traditional ways of having married couples raising a family together in the western world marriages are no longer arranged for economic social or political gain and children are no longer expected to contribute to family income instead people choose mates based on love this increased role of love indicates a societal shift toward favoring emotional fulfilment and relationships within a family and this shift necessarily weakens the institution of the family margaret mead considers the family as a main safeguard to continuing human progress observing human beings have learned laboriously to be human she adds we hold our present form of humanity on trust and it is possible to lose it it is not without significance that the most successful large scale abrogations of the family have occurred not among simple savages living close to the subsistence edge but among great nations and strong empires the resources of which were ample the populations huge and the power almost unlimited many countries particularly western have in recent years changed their family laws in order to accommodate diverse family models for instance in the united kingdom in scotland the family law scotland act 2006 provides cohabitants with some limited rights in 2010 ireland enacted the civil partnership and certain rights and obligations of cohabitants act 2010 there have also been moves at an international level most notably the council of europe european convention on the legal status of children born out of wedlock which came into force in 1978 countries which ratify it must ensure that children born outside marriage are provided with legal rights as stipulated in the text of this convention the convention was ratified by the uk in 1981 and by ireland in 1988 in the united states one in five mothers has children by different fathers among mothers with two or more children the figure is higher with 28 having children with at least two different men such families are more common among blacks and hispanics and among the lower socioeconomic class however in western society the single parent family has been growing more accepted and has begun to make an impact on culture single parent families are more commonly single mother families than single father these families sometimes face difficult issues besides the fact that they have to rear their children on their own for example low income making it difficult to pay for rent child care and other necessities for a healthy and safe home furthermore there are families that consist of two mothers two fathers non binary trans and queer folks raising children this is made possible due to surrogacy ivf iui adoption and other processes domestic violence domestic violence dv is violence that happens within the family the legal and social understanding of the concept of dv differs by culture the definition of the term domestic violence varies depending on the context in which it is used it may be defined differently in medical legal political or social contexts the definitions have varied over time and vary in different parts of the world the convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence states that domestic violence shall mean all acts of physical sexual psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim in 1993 the united nations declaration on the elimination of violence against women identified domestic violence as one of three contexts in which violence against women occurs describing it as physical sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family including battering sexual abuse of female children in the household dowry related violence marital rape female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women non spousal violence and violence related to exploitation family violence family violence is a broader definition often used to include child abuse elder abuse and other violent acts between family members child abuse is defined by the who as child maltreatment sometimes referred to as child abuse and neglect includes all forms of physical and emotional ill treatment sexual abuse neglect and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child s health development or dignity within this broad definition five subtypes can be distinguished physical abuse sexual abuse neglect and negligent treatment emotional abuse and exploitation there exists legislation to prevent and punish the occurrence of these offences there are laws regarding familial sexual activity which states that it is a criminal offence to have any kind of sexual relationship between one s grandparent parent sibling aunt or uncle elder abuse is according to the who a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person parental abuse of children child abuse child abuse is the physical sexual or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children in the united states the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the department for children and families dcf define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm potential for harm or threat of harm to a child child abuse can occur in a child s home or in the organizations schools or communities the child interacts with there are four major categories of child abuse neglect physical abuse psychological or emotional abuse and sexual abuse parental abuse by children abuse of parents by their children is a common but under reported and under researched subject a factor why this subject is under researched is because of the overshadowing effect caused by parents abusing their children instead parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts typically in the form of verbal or physical abuse parents feel a sense of shame and humiliation to have that problem so they rarely seek help and it is usually little or no help available anyway elder abuse elder abuse is a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person this definition has been adopted by the world health organization from a definition put forward by action on elder abuse in the uk laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to laws protecting dependent adults from abuse the core element to the harm of elder abuse is the expectation of trust of the older person toward their abuser thus it includes harms by people the older person knows or with whom they have a relationship such as a spouse partner or family member a friend or neighbor or people that the older person relies on for services many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence forced and child marriage forced and child marriages are practiced in certain regions of the world particularly in asia and africa and these types of marriages are associated with a high rate of domestic violence a forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent the line between forced marriage and consensual marriage may become blurred because the social norms of many cultures dictate that one should never oppose the desire of one s parents relatives in regard to the choice of a spouse in such cultures it is not necessary for violence threats intimidation etc to occur the person simply consents to the marriage even if they do not want it out of the implied social pressure and duty the customs of bride price and dowry that exist in parts of the world can lead to buying and selling people into marriage a child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under 18 child marriage was common throughout history but is today condemned by international human rights organizations child marriages are often arranged between the families of the future bride and groom sometimes as soon as the girl is born child marriages can also occur in the context of marriage by abduction the concept of family honour family honor is an abstract concept involving the perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects the social standing and the self evaluation of a group of related people both corporately and individually the family is viewed as the main source of honor and the community highly values the relationship between honor and the family the conduct of family members reflects upon family honor and the way the family perceives itself and is perceived by others in cultures of honor maintaining the family honor is often perceived as more important than either individual freedom or individual achievement in extreme cases engaging in acts that are deemed to tarnish the honor of the family results in honor killings an honor killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the perpetrators belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an arranged marriage being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives

as well as same sex marriage legal reforms gender equality legal reforms to family laws have taken place in many countries during the past few decades these dealt primarily with gender equality within marriage and with divorce laws women have been given equal rights in marriage in many countries reversing older family laws based on the dominant legal role of the husband coverture which was enshrined in the common law of england and the us for several centuries and throughout most of the 19th century was abolished in some european countries the changes that lead to gender equality were slower the period of 1975 1979 saw a major overhaul of family laws in countries such as italy spain austria west germany and portugal in 1978 the council of europe passed the resolution 78 37 on equality of spouses in civil law among the last european countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were switzerland in 1985 a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within

while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes historically maternal mortality was a major cause of women s death in recent decades advances in healthcare have resulted in rates of maternal mortality having dropped dramatically especially in western countries maternal mortality however remains a serious problem in many african and asian counties infant and child mortality infant mortality is the death of a child less than one year of age child mortality is the death of a child before the child s fifth birthday like maternal mortality infant and child mortality were common throughout history but have decreased significantly in modern times politics while in many parts of the world family policies seek to promote a gender equal organization of the family life in others the male dominated family continues to be the official policy of the authorities which is also supported by law for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 in relations between husband and wife the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband in some parts of the world some governments promote a specific form of family such as that based on traditional family values the term family values is often used in political discourse in some countries its general meaning being that of traditional or cultural values that pertain to the family s structure function roles beliefs attitudes and ideals usually involving the traditional family a middle class family with a breadwinner father and a homemaker mother raising their biological children any deviation from this family model is considered a nontraditional family these family ideals are often advanced through policies such as marriage promotion some jurisdictions outlaw practices which they deem as socially or religiously unacceptable such as fornication cohabitation or adultery work family balance work family balance is a concept involving proper prioritizing between work career and family life it includes issues relating to the way how work and families intersect and influence each other at a political level it is reflected through policies such maternity leave and paternity leave since the 1950s social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers as a tool of changing gender relations protection of private and family life article 8 of the european convention on human rights provides a right to respect for one s private and family life his home and his correspondence subject to certain restrictions that are in accordance with law and necessary in a democratic society article 8 right to respect for private and family life 1 everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence 2 there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security public safety or the economic well being of the country for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedom of others criticism the russian american rationalist and individualist philosopher novelist and playwright ayn rand compared partiality towards consanguinity with racism as a small scale manifestation of the latter the worship of the family is merely racism like a crudely primitive first installment on the worship of the tribe it places the accident of birth above a man s values and duty to the tribe above a man s right to his own life additionally she spoke in favor of childfree lifestyle while following it herself the family and social justice one of the controversies regarding the family is the application of the concept of social justice to the private sphere of family relations in particular with regard to the rights of women and children throughout much of the history most philosophers who advocated for social justice focused on the public political arena not on the family structures with the family often being seen as a separate entity which needed to be protected from outside state intrusion one notable exception was john stuart mill who in his work the subjection of women advocated for greater rights for women within marriage and family second wave feminists argued that the personal is political stating that there are strong connections between personal experiences and the larger social and political structures in the context of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s this was a challenge to the nuclear family and family values as they were understood then feminists focused on domestic violence arguing that the reluctance in law or in practice of the state to intervene and offer protection to women who have been abused within the family is in violation of women s human rights and is the result of an ideology which places family relations outside the conceptual framework of human rights global trends in family composition statistics from an infographic by olivier ballou showed that in 2013 just over 40 of us babies were born outside marriage the census bureau estimated that 27 of all children lived in a fatherless home europe has seen a surge in child free adults one in five 40 something women are childless in sweden and in switzerland in italy one in four in berlin one in three so called traditional societies are seeing the same trend about one sixth of japanese women in their forties have never married and about 30 of all women that age are childless however swedish statisticians reported in 2013 that in contrast to many countries since the 2000s fewer children have experienced their parents separation childlessness had decreased in sweden and marriages had increased it had also become more common for couples to have a third child

perspective to understand feel and possibly share and respond to their experience there are more sometimes conflicting definitions of empathy that include but are not limited to social cognitive and emotional processes primarily concerned with understanding others often times empathy is considered to be a broad term and broken down into more specific concepts and types that include cognitive empathy emotional or affective empathy somatic empathy and spiritual empathy empathy is still a topic of research the major areas of research include the development of empathy the genetics and neuroscience of empathy cross species empathy and the impairment of empathy some researchers have made efforts to quantify empathy through different methods such as from questionnaires where participants can fill out and then be scored on their answers the ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated process however the basic capacity to recognize emotions in others may be innate and may be achieved unconsciously empathy is not all or nothing rather a person can be more or less empathic toward another and empirical research supports a variety of interventions that are able to improve empathy the english word empathy is derived from the ancient greek \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 empatheia meaning physical affection or passion that word derives from \u1f10\u03bd en in at and \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 pathos passion or suffering theodor lipps adapted the german aesthetic term einf\u00fchlung feeling into to psychology in 1903 ch 1 and edward b titchener translated einf\u00fchlung into english as empathy in 1909 in modern greek \u03b5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 may mean depending on context prejudice malevolence malice or hatred definitions since its introduction into the english language empathy has had a wide range of sometimes conflicting definitions among both researchers and laypeople empathy definitions encompass a broad range of phenomena including caring for other people and having a desire to help them experiencing emotions that match another person s discerning what another person is thinking or feeling and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people the way it is characterized derives from the way emotions are characterized for example if emotions are characterized by bodily feelings then understanding the bodily feelings of another will be considered central to empathy on the other hand if emotions are characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires then understanding those beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy paradigmatically a person exhibits empathy when they communicate an accurate recognition of the significance of another person s ongoing intentional actions associated emotional states and personal characteristics in a manner that seems accurate and tolerable to the recognized person this is a nuanced perspective on empathy which assists in the understanding of complex human emotions and interactions acknowledging subjective experiences highlights the need for balance and understanding when engaging in empathy one s ability to recognize the bodily feelings or emotions of another is related to one s imitative capacities and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the proprioceptive feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself distinctions between empathy and related concepts compassion and sympathy are terms associated with empathy a person feels compassion when they notice others are in need and this feeling motivates that person to help like empathy compassion has a wide range of definitions and purported facets which overlap with some definitions of empathy sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need some include in sympathy an empathic concern for another person and the wish to see them better off or happier empathy is also related to pity and emotional contagion one feels pity towards others who might be in trouble or in need of help this feeling is described as feeling sorry for someone emotional contagion is when a person especially an infant or a member of a mob imitatively catches the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening alexithymia describes a deficiency in understanding processing or describing one s own emotions unlike empathy which is about someone else s emotions classification empathy has two major components affective empathy also called emotional empathy is the ability to respond with an appropriate emotion to another s mental states our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion being affected by another s emotional or arousal state affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales empathic concern sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering personal distress feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another s suffering there is no consensus regarding whether personal distress is a form of empathy or instead is something distinct from empathy there may be a developmental aspect to this subdivision infants respond to the distress of others by getting distressed themselves only when they are two years old do they start to respond in other oriented ways trying to help comfort and share affective mentalizing uses clues like body language facial expressions knowledge about the other s beliefs situation and context to understand more about what one is empathizing with cognitive empathy is the ability to understand another s perspective or mental state the terms empathic accuracy social cognition perspective taking theory of mind and mentalizing are often used synonymously but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy it is unclear whether these are equivalent although measures of cognitive empathy include self report questionnaires and behavioral measures a 2019 meta analysis found only a negligible association between self report and behavioral measures suggesting that people are generally not able to accurately assess their own cognitive empathy abilities cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales perspective taking the tendency to spontaneously adopt others psychological perspectives fantasy the tendency to identify with fictional characters tactical or strategic empathy the deliberate use of perspective taking to achieve certain desired ends emotion regulation a damper on the emotional contagion process that allows you to empathize without being overwhelmed by the emotion you are empathizing with the scientific community has not coalesced around a precise definition of these constructs but there is consensus about this distinction affective and cognitive empathy are also independent from one another someone who strongly empathizes emotionally is not necessarily good in understanding another s perspective additional constructs that have been proposed include behavioral empathy which governs how one chooses to respond to feelings of empathy social empathy in which the empathetic person integrates their understanding of broader social dynamics into their empathetic modeling and ecological empathy which encompasses empathy directed towards the natural world in addition fritz breithaupt emphasizes the importance of empathy suppression mechanisms in healthy empathy ch 2 measurement efforts to measure empathy go back to at least the mid twentieth century researchers approach the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring both verbal and non verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters other experimenters required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors or those of other people involved in the experiment as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject s body researchers then draw inferences about that person s empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced bodily or somatic measures can be seen as behavioral measures at a micro level they measure empathy through facial and other non verbally expressed reactions such changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of emotional contagion or mirroring these reactions while they appear to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer could also if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period reflect the results of emotional reactions based on cognitions associated with role taking if i were him i would feel picture or puppet story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young pre school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers dependent variables variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter for younger subjects have included self reporting on a seven point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions in some experiments subjects are required to watch video scenarios either staged or authentic and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form self report measures measures of empathy also frequently require subjects to self report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy using likert style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to reveal the affective cognitive affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning some questionnaires claim to reveal both cognitive and affective substrates however a 2019 meta analysis questions the validity of self report measures of cognitive empathy finding that such self report measures have negligibly small correlations with corresponding behavioral measures balancing subjective self perceptions along with observable behaviors can help to contribute to a more reliable assessment of empathy such measures are also vulnerable to measuring not empathy but the difference between a person s felt empathy and their standards for how much empathy is appropriate for example one researcher found that students scored themselves as less empathetic after taking her empathy class after learning more about empathy the students became more exacting in how they judged their own feelings and behavior expected more from themselves and so rated themselves more severely in the field of medicine a measurement tool for carers is the jefferson scale of physician empathy health professional version jspe hp the interpersonal reactivity index iri is among the oldest published measurement tools still in frequent use first published in 1983 that provides a multi dimensional assessment of empathy it comprises a self report questionnaire of 28 items divided into four seven item scales covering the subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy described above more recent self report tools include the empathy quotient eq created by baron cohen and wheelwright which comprises a self report questionnaire consisting of 60 items another multi dimensional scale is the questionnaire of cognitive and affective empathy qcae first published in 2011 the empathic experience scale is a 30 item questionnaire that measures empathy from a phenomenological perspective on intersubjectivity which provides a common basis for the perceptual experience vicarious experience dimension and a basic cognitive awareness intuitive understanding dimension of others emotional states it is difficult to make comparisons over time using such questionnaires because of how language changes for example one study used a single questionnaire to measure 13 737 college students between 1979 and 2009 and found that empathy scores fell substantially over that time a critic noted these results could be because the wording of the questionnaire had become anachronistically quaint it used idioms no longer in common use like tender feelings ill at ease quite touched or go to pieces that today s students might not identify with development ontogenetic development by the age of two children normally begin to exhibit fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person s emotional state even earlier at one year of age infants have some rudiments of empathy they understand that as with their own actions other people s actions have goals toddlers sometimes comfort others or show concern for them during their second year they play games of falsehood or pretend in an effort to fool others such actions require that the child knows what others believe in order that the child can manipulate those beliefs according to researchers at the university of chicago who used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri children between the ages of seven and twelve when seeing others being injured experience brain activity similar that which would occur if the child themself had been injured their findings are consistent with previous fmri studies of pain empathy with adults and previous findings that vicarious experiencing particularly of others distress is hardwired and present early in life the research found additional areas of the brain associated with social and moral cognition were activated when young people saw another person intentionally hurt by somebody including regions involved in moral reasoning although children are capable of showing some signs of empathy including attempting to comfort a crying baby from as early as 18 months to two years most do not demonstrate a full theory of mind until around the age of four theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one s own and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy children usually can pass false belief tasks a test for a theory of mind around the age of four it is theorised that people with autism find using a theory of mind to be very difficult but there is quite a bit of controversy on this subject e g the sally anne test empathic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the yale university school of nursing it addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients the theory first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions postulates three levels of cognitive structures the third and highest level is a meta ethical theory of the moral structure of care adults who operate with level iii understanding synthesize systems of justice and care based ethics individual differences the empathic concern scale assesses other oriented feelings of sympathy and concern and the personal distress scale measures self oriented feelings of personal anxiety and unease researchers have used behavioral and neuroimaging data to analyze extraversion and agreeableness both are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions that are important for empathic processing medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction sex differences on average females score higher than males on measures of empathy such as the empathy quotient eq while males tend to score higher on the systemizing quotient sq both males and females with autistic spectrum disorders usually score lower on the eq and higher on sq see below for more detail on autism and empathy other studies show no significant sex differences and instead suggest that gender differences are the result of motivational differences such as upholding stereotypes gender stereotypes about men and women can affect how they express emotions the sex difference is small to moderate somewhat inconsistent and is often influenced by the person s motivations or social environment bosson et al say physiological measures of emotion and studies that track people in their daily lives find no consistent sex differences in the experience of emotion which suggests that women may amplify certain emotional expressions or men may suppress them however a 2014 review from neuroscience biobehavioral reviews reported that there is evidence that sex differences in empathy have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots in biology and are not merely cultural byproducts driven by socialization the review found sex differences in empathy from birth growing larger with age and consistent and stable across lifespan females on average had higher empathy than males while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development analysis of brain event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher erp waveforms than males an investigation of n400 amplitudes found on average higher n400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self reported empathy structural fmri studies also found females to have larger grey matter volumes in posterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons in fmri literature females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy the researchers believe that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by environmental influences but rather by human evolution and inheritance throughout prehistory women were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non verbal expressions according to the primary caretaker hypothesis prehistoric men did not have such selective pressure as primary caretakers this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy a review published in neuropsychologia found that females tended to be better at recognizing facial affects expression processing and emotions in general males tended to be better at recognizing specific behaviors such as anger aggression and threatening cues a 2014 meta analysis in cognition and emotion found a small female advantage in non verbal emotional recognition environmental influences some research theorizes that environmental factors such as parenting style and relationships affect the development of empathy in children empathy promotes pro social relationships and helps mediate aggression caroline tisot studied how environmental factors like parenting style parent empathy and prior social experiences affect the development of empathy in young children the children studied were asked to complete an effective empathy measure while the children s parents completed a questionnaire to assess parenting style and the balanced emotional empathy scale the study found that certain parenting practices as opposed to parenting style as a whole contributed to the development of empathy in children these practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent paternal warmth was significantly positively related to empathy in children especially boys maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy in children especially girls empathy may be disrupted due to brain trauma such as stroke in most cases empathy is impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain damage to the frontal lobe which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation can profoundly impact a person s capacity to experience empathy people with an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy more than half of those people with a traumatic brain injury self report a deficit in their empathic capacity there is some evidence that empathy is a skill that one can improve in with training evolution across species studies in animal behavior and neuroscience indicate that empathy is not restricted to humans however the interpretation of such research depends in part on how expansive a definition of empathy researchers adopt empathy like behaviors have been observed in primates both in captivity and in the wild and in particular in bonobos perhaps the most empathic primate one study demonstrated prosocial behavior elicited by empathy in rodents rodents demonstrate empathy for cagemates but not strangers in pain an influential study on the evolution of empathy by stephanie preston and frans de waal discusses a neural perception action mechanism and postulates a bottom up model of empathy that ties together all levels from state matching to perspective taking university of chicago neurobiologist jean decety agrees that empathy is not exclusive to humans but that empathy has deep evolutionary biochemical and neurological underpinnings and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication social attachment and parental care neural circuits involved in empathy and caring include the brainstem the amygdala hypothalamus basal ganglia insula and orbitofrontal cortex other animals and empathy between species researchers zanna clay and frans de waal studied the socio emotional development of the bonobo chimpanzee they focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy related responding and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events events related to themselves e g loss of a fight as well as stressful events of others they found that bonobos sought out body contact with one another as a coping mechanism bonobos sought out more body contact after watching an event distress other bonobos than after their individually experienced stressful event mother reared bonobos sought out more physical contact than orphaned bonobos after a stressful event happened to another this finding shows the importance of mother child attachment and bonding in successful socio emotional development such as empathic like behaviors de waal suggests the advantages provided to mothers who understand the needs of their children are the reason empathy evolved in the first place empathic like behavior has been observed in chimpanzees in different aspects of their natural behaviors for example chimpanzees spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in both natural and unnatural settings a behavior recognized as consolation researchers led by teresa romero observed these empathic and sympathetic like behaviors in chimpanzees in two separate outdoor housed groups acts of consolation were observed in both groups this behavior is also found in humans particularly in human infants another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic like responding was disproportionately provided to kin although comforting towards non family chimpanzees was also observed as with humans chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close loved ones another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average the only exception to this discovery was that high ranking males showed as much empathy like behavior as their female counterparts this is believed to be because of policing like behavior and the authoritative status of high ranking male chimpanzees dogs have been hypothesized to share empathic like responding towards humans researchers custance and mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger when the participants were talking or humming the dog showed no behavioral changes however when the participants were pretending to cry the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger the dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion by sniffing licking and nuzzling the distressed person the dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement tail wagging or panting since the dogs did not direct their empathic like responses only towards their owner it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior although this could suggest that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy it could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior when witnessing chicks in distress domesticated hens gallus gallus domesticus show emotional and physiological responding researchers found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger the mother hen s heart rate increased she sounded vocal alarms she decreased her personal preening and her body temperature increased this responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if it were in danger mother hens experienced stress induced hyperthermia only when the chick s behavior correlated with the perceived threat humans can empathize with other species one study of a sample of organisms showed that the strength of human empathic perceptions and compassionate reactions toward an organism is negatively correlated with how long ago our species had a common ancestor in other words the more phylogenetically close a species is to us the more likely we are to feel empathy and compassion towards it genetics measures of empathy show evidence of being genetically influenced for example carriers of the deletion variant of adra2b show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images the gene 5 httlpr seems to influence sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of adra2b carriers of the double g variant of the oxtr gene have better social skills and higher self esteem a gene located near lrrn1 on chromosome 3 influences the human ability to read understand and respond to emotions in others neuroscientific basis of empathy contemporary neuroscience offers insights into the neural basis of the mind s ability to understand and process emotion studies of mirror neurons attempt to measure the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities and thereby to explain the basis of the empathy reaction people who score high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another s emotional state the empathic person mirrors or mimics the emotional response they would expect to feel if they were in the other person s place unlike personal distress empathy is not characterized by aversion to another s emotional response this distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy or empathic concern and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action empathy involves two interconnected elements cognitive empathy which is understanding or recognising the emotions another person is experiencing and affective empathy which refers to actually feeling or sharing those emotions yourself for social beings negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape meta analysis of fmri studies of empathy confirms that different brain areas are activated during affective perceptual empathy than during cognitive evaluative empathy affective empathy is correlated with increased activity in the insula while cognitive empathy is correlated with activity in the mid cingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex a study with patients who experienced different types of brain damage confirmed the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy specifically the inferior frontal gyrus appears to be responsible for emotional empathy and the ventromedial prefrontal gyrus seems to mediate cognitive empathy fmri has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy observing another person s emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network that are involved in processing that same state in oneself whether it is disgust touch or pain as these emotional states are being observed the brain is able activate a network of the brain that is involved in empathy there are two separate systems of the brain involved with the feeling of empathy a cognitive system and an emotional system the cognitive system helps an individual understand another s perspective while the emotional system enables our ability to empathize emotionally the neuronal network that is activated controls the observers response to these emotional states thus prompting an empathetic response the study of the neural underpinnings of empathy received increased interest following a paper published by s d preston and frans de waal after the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an action and when they themselves perform it researchers suggest that paying attention to perceiving another individual s state activates neural representations and that this activation primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses perception action coupling unless inhibited this mechanism resembles the common coding theory between perception and action another study provides evidence of separate neural pathways activating reciprocal suppression in different regions of the brain associated with the performance of social and mechanical tasks these findings suggest that the cognition associated with reasoning about the state of another person s mind and causal mechanical properties of inanimate objects are neurally suppressed from occurring at the same time mirroring behavior in motor neurons during empathy may help duplicate feelings such sympathetic action may afford access to sympathetic feelings and perhaps trigger emotions of kindness and forgiveness impairment a difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions psychopathy and narcissism are associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy whereas bipolar disorder is associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy people with borderline personality disorder bpd may suffer from impairments in cognitive empathy as well as fluctuating affective empathy although this topic is controversial schizophrenia too is associated with deficits in both types of empathy however even in people without conditions such as these the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies atypical empathic responses are associated with some personality disorders such as psychopathy borderline narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders conduct disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder and depersonalization sex offenders who had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured abuse of the sort they later committed felt less affective empathy for their victims autism and controversy the subject of whether autism affects empathy is a controversial and complex area of study several different factors are proposed to be at play such as mirror neurons alexithymia and more the double empathy problem theory proposes that prior studies on autism and empathy may have been misinterpreted and that autistic people show the same levels of empathy towards one another as non autistic people do autism spectrum disorder asd is often correlated to problems with empathy and social communication skills however like asd itself these issues are often found to be on a spectrum the suggestion that people with autism are likely to have issues with personal relationships and empathy is a complex issue that has been addressed in many studies various research has been exploring these concepts for more than twenty years certain studies like this one from 2004 found connections between asd and empathy issues another study found that empathy problems may be associated to the comorbidity of alexithymia a struggle to feel emotions and asd however a more recent study from 2022 found that there were in fact no significant differences between the brain sections medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala that are associated with empathy another study 2023 focusing on asd and empathy with regards to mirror neurons also reflected on the theory that mirror neurons may be dysfunctional in asd however as the researchers state this connection is not clear and although mirror neurons are correlated to asd there is no proven causational relationship between dysfunctional mirror neurons and asd the study from 2023 might be considered contradictory to an earlier 2006 study on mirror neurons that found that high functioning autistic children showed reduced mirror neuron activity in the brain s inferior frontal gyrus while imitating and observing emotional expressions in other children who were considered non autistic the correlation between asd and empathy is a focus for researchers and many relevant articles can be found in the journal of autism and developmental disorders psychopathy psychopathy is a personality construct partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of remorse and empathy the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm and international classification of diseases icd list antisocial personality disorder aspd and dissocial personality disorder stating that these have been referred to as or include what is referred to as psychopathy psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues e g facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear and impairments of empathy studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations the underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths although less responsive than in those of controls the neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear some fmri studies report that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions positives and negatives one study on psychopaths found that under certain circumstances they could willfully empathize with others and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls psychopathic criminals were brain scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual the psychopaths empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt the research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy on at will which would enable them to be both callous and charming the team who conducted the study say they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their empathy switch others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths experience of empathy was the same as that of controls and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic one problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and punishment as psychopathy as these entail suspending empathy towards certain individuals and or groups the attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry s standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures as opposed to an actual difference in the brain work conducted by professor jean decety with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights in one study psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt they were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain the participants in the high psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex amygdala and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain but more activity in the striatum and the insula when compared to control participants in a second study individuals with psychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain affective brain regions when taking an imagine self perspective but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine other perspective in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala which may contribute to their lack of empathic concern researchers have investigated whether people who have high levels of psychopathy have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but lack the ability to use affective empathy people who score highly on psychopathy measures are less likely to exhibit affective empathy there was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and lack of affective empathy correspond strongly the danva 2 found those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions therefore such individuals do not lack in perspective talking ability but do lack in compassion regarding the experiences of others neuroscientist antonio r damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these brain damaged patients coldly came up with end justifies the means answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains according to adrian raine a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this study s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability despite studies suggesting psychopaths have deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain professor simon baron cohen claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors social cues and what others are feeling psychopathy is however associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy affective emotional empathy which includes the ability to feel the suffering and emotions of others emotional contagion and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has been demonstrated for aggressive offenders other conditions atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions borderline personality disorder is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior plays a role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react while individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions excessively their ability to feel empathy is a topic of much dispute with contradictory findings some studies assert impairments in cognitive empathy in bpd patients yet no affective empathy impairments while other studies have found impairments in both affective and cognitive empathy fluctuating empathy fluctuating between normal range of empathy reduced sense of empathy and a lack of empathy has been noted to be present in bpd patients in multiple studies although more research is needed to determine its prevalence although it is believed to be at least not uncommon and may be a very common phenomenon bpd is a very heterogenous disorder with symptoms including empathy ranging wildly between patients one diagnostic criterion of narcissistic personality disorder is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others characteristics of schizoid personality disorder include emotional coldness detachment and impaired affect corresponding with an inability to be empathic and sensitive towards others a study conducted by jean decety and colleagues at the university of chicago demonstrated that subjects with aggressive conduct disorder demonstrate atypical empathic responses when viewing others in pain subjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as controls to the pain of others but unlike controls subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the amygdala and ventral striatum areas that enable a general arousing effect of reward yet impaired activation of the neural regions involved in self regulation and metacognition including moral reasoning in addition to diminished processing between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex schizophrenia is characterized by impaired affective empathy as well as severe cognitive and empathy impairments as measured by the empathy quotient eq these empathy impairments are also associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks bipolar individuals have impaired cognitive empathy and theory of mind but increased affective empathy despite cognitive flexibility being impaired planning behavior is intact dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex could result in the impaired cognitive empathy since impaired cognitive empathy has been related with neurocognitive task performance involving cognitive flexibility dave grossman in his book on killing reports on how military training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other people a deadening of empathic response to workmates customers and the like is one of the three key components of occupational burnout according to the conceptualization behind its primary diagnostic instrument the maslach burnout inventory the term empathy deficit disorder edd has gained popularity online but it is not a diagnosis under the dsm 5 the term was coined in an article by douglas labier in the article he acknowledges that he made it up so you won t find it listed in the american psychiatric association s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders and that his conclusions are derived from personal experience alone his conclusions have not been validated through clinical studies nor have studies identified edd as a separate disorder rather than a symptom associated with previously established diagnoses that do appear in the dsm 5 effects the capacity to empathize is a revered trait in society empathy is considered a motivating factor for unselfish prosocial behavior whereas a lack of empathy is related to antisocial behavior apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning such empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another two general methods have been identified an individual may mentally simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs desires character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings this provokes or an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then analyze the environment to discover a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment an empathizer s emotional background may affect or distort how they perceive the emotions in others societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy the judgments that empathy provides about the emotional states of others are not certain ones empathy is a skill that gradually develops throughout life and which improves the more contact we have with the person with whom one empathizes empathizers report finding it easier to take the perspective of another person in a situation when they have experienced a similar situation and that they experience greater empathic understanding research regarding whether similar past experience makes the empathizer more accurate is mixed the extent to which a person s emotions are publicly observable or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable this is particularly the case when we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions based on a metaphorical affinity with touch philosopher edith wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party benefits of empathizing people who score more highly on empathy questionnaires also report having more positive relationships with other people supporting this a 2017 study measuring dispositional empathy with the interpersonal reactivity index iri found that individuals with higher empathic concern report having a greater number of close relationships they report greater life satisfaction more positive affect less negative affect and less depressive symptoms than people who had lower empathy scores children who exhibit more empathy also have more resilience research by allemand steiger and fend 2015 support this by showing many benefits that come with the early development of empathy in adolescence the main findings of the research indicate that early development of empathy in adolescence will help predict social competencies in adulthood in other words their future ability to work well in groups build relationships and communicate effectively others include the development of social skills cooperation and positive relations in life which further proves the benefit of empathy empathy can be an aesthetic pleasure by widening the scope of that which we experience by providing us with more than one perspective of a situation thereby multiplying our experience and by intensifying that experience epilogue people can use empathy to borrow joy from the joy of children discovering things or playing make believe or to satisfy our curiosity about other people s lives empathic inaccuracy and empathic bias people can severely overestimate how much they understand others when people empathize with another they may oversimplify that other person in order to make them more legible it may improve empathic accuracy for the empathizer to explicitly ask the person empathized with for confirmation of the empathic hypothesis however people may be reluctant to abandon their empathic hypotheses even when they are explicitly denied because we oversimplify people in order to make them legible enough to empathize with we can come to misapprehend how cohesive other people are we may come to think of ourselves as lacking a strong integral self in comparison fritz breithaupt calls this the empathic endowment effect because the empathic person must temporarily dampen their own sense of self in order to empathize with the other and because the other seems to have a magnified and extra cohesive sense of self the empathic person may suffer from this and may project onto others the self that they are lacking and envy that which they must give up in order to be able to feel empathy a strong self some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves in particular empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent 62 a measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person s thoughts and feelings was developed by william ickes in one experiment researchers gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported each participant received a mild electric shock then watched another go through the same pain when the wristbands matched both brains flared with pain and empathic pain if they supported opposing teams the observer was found to have little empathy disadvantages of empathy psychologist paul bloom author of against empathy points out that empathic bias can result in tribalism and violent responses in the name of helping people of the same tribe or social group for example when empathic bias is exploited by demagogues he proposes rational compassion as an alternative one example is using effective altruism to decide on charitable donations rationally rather than by relying on emotional responses to images in the media higher empathy tends to reduce the accuracy of deception detection and emotion recognition training does not improve deception detection empathy can also be exploited by sympathetic beggars bloom points to the example of street children in india who can get many donations because they are adorable but this results in their enslavement by organized crime bloom says that though someone might feel better about themselves and find more meaning in life than they give to the person in front of them in some cases they would do less harm and in many cases do more good in the world by giving to an effective charity through an impersonal website bloom believes improper use of empathy and social intelligence can lead to shortsighted actions and parochialism bloom points out that parents who have too much short term empathy might create long term problems for their children by neglecting discipline helicopter parenting or deciding not to get their children vaccinated because of the short term discomfort people experiencing too much empathy after a disaster may continue to send donations like canned goods or used clothing even after being asked to stop or to send cash instead and this can make the situation worse by creating the need to dispose of useless donations and taking resources away from helpful activities bloom also finds empathy can encourage unethical behavior when it causes people to care more about attractive people than ugly people or people of one s own race vs people of a different race the attractiveness bias can also affect wildlife conservation efforts increasing the amount of money devoted and laws passed to protect cute and photogenic animals while taking attention away from species that are more ecologically important empathy and power people tend to empathize less when they have more social or political power for example people from lower class backgrounds exhibit better empathic accuracy than those from upper class backgrounds in a variety of priming experiments people who were asked to recall a situation in which they had power over someone else then demonstrated reduced ability to mirror others to comprehend their viewpoints or to learn from their perspectives empathy and violence bloom says that although psychopaths have low empathy the correlation between low empathy and violent behavior as documented in scientific studies is zero other measures are much more predictive of violent behavior such as lack of self control compassion fatigue excessive empathy can lead to empathic distress fatigue especially if it is associated with pathological altruism the medical risks are fatigue occupational burnout guilt shame anxiety and depression tania singer says that health care workers and caregivers must be objective regarding the emotions of others they should not over invest their own emotions in the other at the risk of draining away their own resourcefulness paul bloom points out that high empathy nurses tend to spend less time with their patients to avoid feeling negative emotions associated with witnessing suffering empathy backfire despite empathy being often portrayed as a positive attribute whether or not the people who express empathy are viewed favorably depends on who they show empathy for such is the case in which a third party observes a subject showing empathy for someone of questionable character or generally viewed as unethical that third party might not like or respect the subject for it this is called empathy backfire influence on helping behavior investigators into the social response to natural disasters researched the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims researchers found that cognitive empathy rather than emotional empathy predicted helping behavior towards victims taking on the perspectives of others cognitive empathy may allow these helpers to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort whereas sharing the emotions of the victims emotional empathy can cause emotional distress helplessness and victim blaming and may lead to avoidance rather than helping individuals who expressed concern for the vulnerable i e affective empathy were more willing to accept the covid 19 pandemic lockdown measures that create distress people who understand how empathic feelings evoke altruistic motivation may adopt strategies for suppressing or avoiding such feelings such numbing or loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients is a possible factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions people can better cognitively control their actions the more they understand how altruistic behavior emerges whether it is from minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons empathy induced altruism may not always produce pro social effects for example it could lead one to exert oneself on behalf of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro social goals thus inducing a type of bias researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt empathy based socialization differs from inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping modeling and internalized guilt therapeutic programs to foster altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations especially in the long term empathy induced altruism can improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups racial attitudes and actions toward people with aids the homeless and convicts such resulting altruism also increases cooperation in competitive situations empathy is good at prompting prosocial behaviors that are informal unplanned and directed at someone who is immediately present but is not as good at prompting more abstractly considered long term prosocial behavior empathy can not only be a precursor to one s own helpful acts but can also be a way of inviting help from others if you mimic the posture facial expressions and vocal style of someone you are with you can thereby encourage them to help you and to form a favorable opinion of you conflict resolution empathy plays a crucial role in resolving conflicts by shifting the focus to understanding the other person s viewpoint preventing miscommunication and taking away biases being able to understand the other party s side of the argument gives them a different idea of what is creating the conflict this helps in communicating the problem in a way that will take away any biases and allow for collaboration that will help resolve the conflict while empathy can play an effective role in conflict resolution there are situations where it may not have a significant impact empathic anger and distress anger empathic anger is an emotion a form of empathic distress empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing empathic anger affects desires to help and to punish two sub categories of empathic anger are state empathic anger current empathic anger and trait empathic anger tendency or predisposition to experience empathic anger the higher a person s perspective taking ability the less angry they are in response to a provocation empathic concern does not however significantly predict anger response and higher personal distress is associated with increased anger distress empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person this feeling can be transformed into empathic anger feelings of injustice or guilt these emotions can be perceived as pro social however views differ as to whether they serve as motives for moral behavior stoic philosophers believed that to condition your emotional disposition on the emotions or fortunes of someone else is foolish cicero said that someone who feels distress at another s misfortune is committing as much of an error as an envious person who feels distress at another s good fortune disciplinary approaches philosophy ethics in the 2007 book the ethics of care and empathy philosopher michael slote introduces a theory of care based ethics that is grounded in empathy he claims that moral motivation does and should stem from a basis of empathic response and that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy he explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural these natural obligations include a greater empathic and moral obligation to family and friends and to those close to us in time and space our moral obligation to such people seems naturally stronger to us than that to strangers at a distance slote explains that this is due to the natural process of empathy he asserts that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent in a 2011 article philosopher michael slote delves deeply into how empathy plays a role in moral judgment suggesting that our ability to understand and determine right from wrong is influenced by empathy he further stated that being able to empathize with others helps us stay away from behaviors that some deem to be unreasonable or heartless which can happen because of a lack of empathy phenomenology in phenomenology empathy describes the experience of something from the other s viewpoint without confusion between self and other this is based on the concept of agency in the most basic sense phenomenology is the experience of the other s body as my body over there in most other respects however it is an experience viewed through the person s own eyes in experiencing empathy what is experienced is not my experience even though i experience it empathy is also considered to be the condition of intersubjectivity and as such the source of the constitution of objectivity history some postmodernist historians such as keith jenkins have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant liberal discourse of modern society and can be connected to john stuart mill s concept of reciprocal freedom jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the epistemological conditions of bygone ages we are unable to empathize with those who lived then psychotherapy heinz kohut introduced the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis his principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material business and management because empathy seems to have potential to improve customer relations employee morale and personnel management capability it has been studied in a business context in the 2009 book wired to care strategy consultant dev patnaik argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations he states that without empathy people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon he says that companies can create a sense of empathy for customers pointing to nike harley davidson and ibm as examples of open empathy organizations such companies he claims see new opportunities more quickly than competitors adapt to change more easily and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs in the 2011 book the empathy factor organizational consultant marie miyashiro similarly argues for bringing empathy to the workplace and suggests nonviolent communication as an effective mechanism for achieving this in studies by the management research group empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness the leadership consulting firm development dimensions international found in 2016 that 20 of u s employers offered empathy training to managers a study by the center for creative leadership found empathy to be positively correlated to job performance among employees as well patricia moore pioneered using empathic techniques to better understand customers for example she used makeup and prosthetics to simulate the experience of elderly people and used the insights from this to inspire friendlier products for that customer segment design engineers at ford motor company wore prosthetics to simulate pregnancy and old age to help them design cars that would work better for such customers fidelity investments trains its telephone customer service employees in a virtual reality app that puts them in a dramatized customer s home so they can experience what it is like to be on the other side of their conversations evolution of cooperation empathic perspective taking plays important roles in sustaining cooperation in human societies as studied by evolutionary game theory in game theoretical models indirect reciprocity refers to the mechanism of cooperation based on moral reputations that are assigned to individuals based on their perceived adherence a set of moral rules called social norms it has been shown that if reputations are relative and individuals disagree on the moral standing of others for example because they use different moral evaluation rules or make errors of judgement then cooperation will not be sustained however when individuals have the capacity for empathic perspective taking altruistic behavior can once again evolve moreover evolutionary models also revealed that empathic perspective taking itself can evolve promoting prosocial behavior in human populations in educational contexts another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners research shows that empathy is important in developing classroom dynamics fostering student engagement and enhancing academic outcomes in 2022 a systematic review of empathy s effectiveness in teaching shows that empathetic teacher student relationships can result in a positive learning environment also a study at stanford university found that when a teacher applies active listening and emotional awareness approaches it can lead to a significant 50 decrease in suspension rates it also shows empathy s ability to lessen discipline issues and create desirable academic outcomes despite the positive outcomes the philosophy of empathy emphasizes that empathy is deeply connected to morality which helps us understand that developing empathy in teachers is challenging learning by teaching is one method used to teach empathy research also found that it is difficult to develop empathy in trainee teachers learning by teaching is one method used to teach empathy students transmit new content to their classmates so they have to reflect continuously on those classmates mental processes this develops the students feeling for group reactions and networking carl r rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have other research and meta analyses corroborated the importance of these person centered traits within medical education a hidden curriculum appears to dampen or even reduce medical student empathy in intercultural contexts according to one theory empathy is one of seven components involved in the effectiveness of intercultural communication this theory also states that empathy is learnable however research also shows that people experience more difficulty empathizing with others who are different from them in characteristics such as status culture religion language skin colour gender and age to build intercultural empathy in others psychologists employ empathy training researchers william weeks paul pedersen et al state that people who develop intercultural empathy can interpret experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview intercultural empathy can also improve self awareness and critical awareness of one s own interaction style as conditioned by one s cultural views and promote a view of self as process in fiction the greatest benefits we owe to the artist whether painter poet or novelist is the extension of our sympathies appeals founded on generalizations and statistics require a sympathy ready made a moral sentiment already in activity but a picture of human life such as a great artist can give surprises even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart from themselves which may be called the raw material of moral sentiment art is the nearest thing to life it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow men beyond the bounds of our personal lot lynn hunt argued in inventing human rights a history that the concept of human rights developed how it did and when it did in part as a result of the influence of mid eighteenth century european novelists particularly those whose use of the epistolatory novel form gave readers a more vivid sense that they were gaining access to the candid details of a real life the epistolatory novel did not just reflect important cultural and social changes of the time novel reading actually helped create new kinds of feelings including a recognition of shared psychological experiences and these feelings then translated into new cultural and social movements including human rights the power of empathy has become a frequent ability in fiction specifically in that of superhero media empaths have the ability to sense feel the emotions and bodily sensations of others and in some cases influence or control them although sometimes a specific power held by specific characters such as the marvel comics character empath the power has also been frequently linked to that of telepathy such as in the case of jean grey the rebooted television series charmed portrays the character maggie vera as a witch with the power of empathy her powers later expand to allow her to control the emotions of others as well as occasionally concentrate emotion into pure energy in season four she learns to replicate people s powers by empathically understanding them in the 2013 nbc television show reinterpretation of hannibal we are introduced in the first episode to will graham graham is unique in that he seems to have exceptionally high levels of both cognitive and emotional empathy combined with an eidetic memory and imagination these abilities help him understand the motives of some of the most depraved killers hannibal lecter calls his ability pure empathy graham can assume the viewpoint of virtually anyone he meets even viewpoints that sicken him when evaluating a crime scene he uses his imagination and empathy to almost become the killer feeling what they were feeling during a murder empathy is a skill in the 2019 game disco elysium it passively reveals what other characters are feeling see also references further

zalta en ed empathy stanford encyclopedia of philosophy", "Human nature": "human nature comprises the fundamental dispositions and characteristics including ways of thinking feeling and acting that humans are said to have naturally the term is often used to denote the essence of humankind or what it means to be human this usage has proven to be controversial in that there is dispute as to whether or not such an essence actually exists arguments about human nature have been a central focus of philosophy for centuries and the concept continues to provoke lively philosophical debate while both concepts are distinct from one another discussions regarding human nature are typically related to those regarding the comparative importance of genes and environment in human development i e nature versus nurture accordingly the concept also continues to play a role in academic fields such as both the natural and the social sciences and philosophy in which various theorists claim to have yielded insight into human nature human nature is traditionally contrasted with human attributes that vary among societies such as those associated with specific cultures the concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments is traditionally said to have begun in greek philosophy at least in regard to its heavy influence on western and middle eastern languages and perspectives by late antiquity and medieval times the particular approach that came to be dominant was that of aristotle s teleology whereby human nature was believed to exist somehow independently of individuals causing humans to simply become what they become this in turn has been understood as also demonstrating a special connection between human nature and divinity whereby human nature is understood in terms of final and formal causes more specifically this perspective believes that nature itself or a nature creating divinity has intentions and goals including the goal for humanity to live naturally such understandings of human nature see this nature as an idea or form of a human however the existence of this invariable and metaphysical human nature is subject of much historical debate continuing into modern times against aristotle s notion of a fixed human nature the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries firstly by early modernists such as thomas hobbes john locke and jean jacques rousseau in his emile or on education rousseau wrote we do not know what our nature permits us to be since the early 19th century such thinkers as darwin freud marx kierkegaard nietzsche and sartre as well as structuralists and postmodernists more generally have also sometimes argued against a fixed or innate human nature charles darwin s theory of evolution has particularly changed the shape of the discussion supporting the proposition that the ancestors of modern humans were not like humans today as in much of modern science such theories seek to explain with little or no recourse to metaphysical causation they can be offered to explain the origins of human nature and its underlying mechanisms or to demonstrate capacities for change and diversity which would arguably violate the concept of a fixed human nature classical greek philosophy philosophy in classical greece is the ultimate origin of the western conception of the nature of things according to aristotle the philosophical study of human nature itself originated with socrates who turned philosophy from study of the heavens to study of the human things though leaving no written works socrates is said to have studied the question of how a person should best live it is clear from the works of his students plato and xenophon and also from the accounts of aristotle plato s student that socrates was a rationalist and believed that the best life and the life most suited to human nature involved reasoning the socratic school was the dominant surviving influence in philosophical discussion in the middle ages amongst islamic christian and jewish philosophers the human soul in the works of plato and aristotle has a nature that is divided in a specifically human way one part is specifically human and rational being further divided into 1 a part which is rational on its own and 2 a spirited part which can understand reason other parts of the soul are home to desires or passions similar to those found in animals in both aristotle and plato s ideas spiritedness thumos is distinguished from the other passions epith\u016bm\u00ed\u0101 the proper function of the rational was to rule the other parts of the soul helped by spiritedness by this account using one s reason is the best way to live and philosophers are the highest types of humans aristotle aristotle plato s most famous student made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature in his works apart from using a similar scheme of a divided human soul some clear statements about human nature are made in contrast to other animals humans have reason or language logos in their soul psyche according to aristotle this means that the work ergos of a human is the actualization energeia of the soul in accordance with reason based upon this reasoning the medieval followers of aristotle formulated the doctrine that man is the rational animal man is a conjugal animal an animal that is born to couple in adulthood in doing so man builds a household oikos and in more successful cases a clan or small village run upon patriarchal lines however humans naturally tend to connect their villages into cities poleis which are more self sufficient and complete man is a political animal an animal with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities i e the size of a city or town with systems of law making and a division of labor this type of community is different in kind from a large family and requires the use of human reason cities should not be run by a patriarch like a village man is a mimetic animal man loves to use his imagination and not only to make laws and run town councils w e enjoy looking at accurate likenesses of things which are themselves painful to see obscene beasts for instance and corpses the reason why we enjoy seeing likenesses is that as we look we learn and infer what each is for instance that is so and so for aristotle reason is not only what is most special about humanity compared to other animals but it is also what we were meant to achieve at our best much of aristotle s description of human nature is still influential today however the particular teleological idea that humans are meant or intended to be something has become much less popular in modern times theory of four causes for the socratics human nature and all natures are metaphysical concepts aristotle developed the standard presentation of this approach with his theory of four causes whereby every living thing exhibits four aspects or causes matter hyle form eidos effect kinoun and end telos for example an oak tree is made of plant cells matter grows from an acorn effect exhibits the nature of oak trees form and grows into a fully mature oak tree end according to aristotle human nature is an example of a formal cause likewise our end is to become a fully actualized human being including fully actualizing the mind aristotle suggests that the human intellect \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 no\u00fbs while smallest in bulk is the most significant part of the human psyche and should be cultivated above all else the cultivation of learning and intellectual growth of the philosopher is thereby also the happiest and least painful life chinese philosophy confucianism human nature is a central question in chinese philosophy from the song dynasty the theory of innate goodness of human beings became dominant in confucianism it is in contrast to the theory of innate evil advocated by xunzi mencius mencius argues that human nature is good he understands human nature as the innate tendency to an ideal state that s expected to be formed under the right conditions therefore humans have the capacity to be good even though they are not all good according to mencian theory human nature contains four beginnings \u7aef duan of morality it consists of a sense of compassion that develops into benevolence \u4ec1 ren a sense of shame and disdain that develops into righteousness \u7fa9 yi a sense of respect and courtesy that develops into propriety \u79ae li and a sense of right and wrong that develops into wisdom \u667a zhi the beginnings of morality are characterized by both affective motivations and intuitive judgments such as what s right and wrong deferential respectful or disdainful in mencius view goodness is the result of the development of innate tendencies toward the virtues of benevolence righteousness wisdom and propriety the tendencies are manifested in moral emotions for every human being reflection \u601d si upon the manifestations of the four beginnings leads to the development of virtues it brings recognition that virtue takes precedence over satisfaction but a lack of reflection inhibits moral development in other words humans have a constitution comprising emotional predispositions that direct them to goodness mencius also addresses the question why the capacity for evil is not grounded in human nature if an individual becomes bad it is not the result of his or her constitution as their constitution contains the emotional predispositions that direct to goodness but a matter of injuring or not fully developing his or her constitution in the appropriate direction he recognizes desires of the senses as natural predispositions distinct from the four beginnings people can be misled and led astray by their desires if they do not engage their ethical motivations he therefore places responsibility on people to reflect on the manifestations of the four beginnings herein it is not the function of ears and eyes but the function of the heart to reflect as sensory organs are associated with sensual desires but the heart is the seat of feeling and thinking mencius considers core virtues benevolence righteousness propriety and wisdom as internal qualities that humans originally possess so people can not attain full satisfaction by solely pursuits of self interest due to their innate morality wong 2018 underscores that mencius characterization of human nature as good means that it contains predispositions to feel and act in morally appropriate ways and to make intuitive normative judgments that can with the right nurturing conditions give human beings guidance as to the proper emphasis to be given to the desires of the senses xunzi xunzi understands human nature as the basic faculties capacities and desires that people have from birth he views it as the animalistic instincts exhibited by humans before education which includes greed idleness and desires he suggests that people can not get rid of these instincts so the existence of this human nature necessitates education and cultivation of goodness xunzi argues that human nature is evil and that any goodness is the result of human activity it is human nature to seek profit because humans desire for sensory satisfaction he states that now the nature of man is evil it must depend on teachers and laws to become correct and achieve propriety and righteousness and then it becomes disciplined he underscores that goodness comes from the traits and habits acquired through conscious actions which he calls artifice \u507d wei therefore morality is seen as a human artifice but not as a part of human nature his claim that human nature is bad according to ivanhoe 1994 means that humans do not have a conception of morality and therefore must acquire it through learning lest destructive and alienating competition inevitably arises from human desire legalism legalism is based on a distrust of human nature adherents to this philosophy do not concern themselves with whether human goodness or badness is inborn and whether human beings possess the fundamental qualities associated with that nature legalists see the overwhelming majority of human beings as selfish in nature they hold the view that human nature is evil they believe that one should not expect that people will behave morally for instance due to the corrupt nature of humans they did not trust that officials would carry out their duties in a fair and impartial manner there is a perpetual political struggle characterized by conflict among contending human actors and interests where individuals are easily tempted due to their selfish nature at the expense of others according to legalism the selfishness in human nature can not be eliminated or altered by education or self cultivation it dismisses the possibility that people can overcome their selfishness and considers the possibility that people can be driven by moral commitment to be exceptionally rare legalists do not see the individual morality of both the rulers or the ruled as an important concern in a political system instead legalist thinkers such as han fei emphasize clear and impersonal norms and standards such as laws regulations and rules as the basis to maintain order in han fei s view a core feature of human nature is that humans are selfish but that their desires are satiable he argues that competition for external goods produces disorder during times of scarcity due to this nature if there is no scarcity humans may treat each other well but they will not become nice it is that they do not turn to disorder when scarcity is absent han fei also argues that people are all motivated by their unchanging selfish core to want whatever advantage they can gain from whomever they can gain such advantage which especially comes to expression in situations where people can act with impunity legalists posit that the selfishness in human nature can be an asset rather than a threat to a state it is axiomatic in legalism that the government can not be staffed by upright and trustworthy men of service because every member of the elite like any other member of society will pursue their own interests and thus must be employed for their interests herein individuals must be allowed to pursue their selfish interests exclusively in a manner that benefits rather than contradicts the needs of a state therefore a political system that presupposes this human selfishness is the only viable system in contrast a political system based on trust and respect rather than impersonal norms and standards brings great concern with regard to an ongoing and irresolvable power struggle legalists propose that control is a foundation of governing which is achieved through reward and punishment they view the usage of reward and punishment as effective political controls as it is in human nature to have likes and dislikes for instance according to the legalist statesman shang yang it is crucial to investigate the disposition of people in terms of rewards and penalties when a law is established he explains that a populace can not be driven to pursuits of agriculture or warfare if people consider these to be bitter or dangerous on the basis of calculations about their possible benefits but people can be directed toward these pursuits through the application of positive and negative incentives on the selfishness in human nature han fei remarks that those who act as ministers fear the penalties and hope to profit by the rewards in han fei s view the only realistic option is a political system that produces equivalents of junzi \u541b\u5b50 who are virtuous exemplars in confucianism but not actual junzi this does not mean however that han fei makes a distinction between seeming and being good as he does not entertain the idea that humans are good rather as human nature is constituted by self interest he argues that humans can be shaped behaviorally to yield social order if it is in the individual s own self interest to abide by the norms i e different interests are aligned to each other and the social good which is most efficiently ensured if the norms are publicly and impartially enforced medieval and renaissance philosophy medieval conceptions of man were particularly stimulated by two sources viz the bible and the classical philosophical tradition in scripture two passages especially provided the foundation of a dynamic anthropology gen 1 26 and wis 2 23 where it is said that man was created in the image of god no theologian could dispense with a reflection on the foundations and consequences of the vision of man implied in this statement while bernard of clairvaux considered that man was the image of god by inamissible free will de gratia et libero arbitrio iv 9 ix 28 the majority of authors envisaged a likeness between god and man that was based on reason thus according to thomas aquinas man can be called imago dei by reason of his intellectual nature for intellectual nature imitates god especially in that god knows himself and loves himself summa theologiae i a q 93 a 4 according to bonaventure all created being is a vestige of god while beings endowed with intelligence are images of god since god is present in acts of memory intellect and will as their principle by an original fusion of christology and the doctrine of man as image of god meister eckhart wished to go beyond the traditional distinction between the son image of the father and man created in the image of god the motif of man as a microcosm in which the universe is reflected is of ancient origin this understanding of the human being enjoyed immense success in the 12th century when authors as different as bernardus silvestris and godfrey of saint victor made use of it hildegard of bingen and honorius augustodunensis developed a whole system of correspondences between the little world and the universe the macrocosm correspondences that also played a far from negligible role in medieval medicine and the doctrine of the four temperaments the origin of the definition of man as a rational animal also went back to antiquity the problem of the relation between the soul and the body which was implicitly contained in this definition gave rise to very important debates after the arrival of aristotle in the west and the translation of greek and arabic philosophical texts the dualist position whose cause was brilliantly defended by bonaventure stated that man was composed of two substances the soul being joined to the body as mover it is patent that the postulate of ontological autonomy of the soul supposed in this position accords easily with the religious belief in the immortality of the soul the aristotelian doctrine of the soul as act of the organic body and hence as the form of the body seemed to pose more of a problem as a thesis on which to base immortality in accepting aristotelian hylomorphism thomas aquinas insisted on the unity of the human composite the intellective soul is hence the form by which man is a being in act a body a living thing an animal and a man summa theologiae i a q 76 a 6 ad 1 by the act of intellection which in its exercise is independent of the body thomas tried to demonstrate that the soul is capable of existing without the body hence the intellectual principle in other words the spirit the intellect possesses by itself an activity in which the body has no part now nothing can act by itself that does not exist by itself it remains that the human soul i e the intellect the spirit is an incorporeal and subsistent reality summa theologiae i a q 75 a 2 by the 14th century william of ockham jean buridan the philosophical proofs of the soul s immortality were contested but the debate was particularly lively in the 15th and early 16th centuries marsilio ficino s platonic theology 1474 can be understood as a vast defence of the immortality of the soul while pietro pomponazzi 1525 fought most vigorously against the very idea of any proof in favour of immortality the rediscovery of the aristotelian corpus favoured the discussion of another anthropological formula in his politics i 2 1253 a 1 2 aristotle advanced the idea that man was a political animal this conception opened up the possibility of a political anthropology of which marsilius of padua and dante alighieri provide remarkable examples membership of the human community was perceived as a constitutive element of humanity in this context certain authors reflected on communication and discovered that language was also constitutive of humanity it is proper to man said thomas aquinas to use words to express his thoughts it is true that the other animals communicate their passions roughly as the dog expresses his anger by barking hence man is much more communicative towards others than any animal whatever that we see living gregariously like the crane the ant or the bee de regno ch 1 the theme of the dignity of man manifests yet another aspect of medieval anthropology an astonishing expression of it appears in john scotus eriugena s de divisione naturae book iv where it is said of man that his substance is the notion by which he knows himself pl 122 770a this optimism contrasts with the perspectives sketched out by lotario dei segni the future pope innocent iii in the opusculum de miseria condicionis humane 1195 119 which offers a striking picture of man s weaknesses and infirmities when in 1452 giannozzo manetti eulogized the beauty and excellence of man body and soul he wished to reply to the lamentation of innocent whose work had an immense success giovanni pico della mirandola too in his celebrated discourse on the dignity of man expounded a very high idea of man pico celebrated first the radical freedom of man who is capable of choosing himself i e of giving himself his own essence i have given you neither a determined place nor a face of your own says the creator nor any particular gift o adam so that your place your face and your gifts you may will conquer and possess by yourself nature encloses other species in laws established by me but you whom no boundary limits by your own free will in whose hands i have placed you define yourself this anthropology which has been celebrated as the beginning of modernity is not in opposition to religion since this dignity of man belongs to him precisely because he is the image of god according to the biblical word yet with an unprecedented intensity pico was able to give a luminous and powerful expression to this profound truth that man outruns in advance all defined concept of man o boulnois christian theology in christian theology there are two ways of conceiving human nature the first is spiritual biblical and theistic and the second is natural cosmical and anti theistic 6 the focus in this section is on the former as william james put it in his study of human nature from a religious perspective religion has a department of human nature various views of human nature have been held by theologians however there are some basic assertions in all biblical anthropology humankind has its origin in god its creator humans bear the image of god humans are to rule the rest of creation the bible contains no single doctrine of human nature rather it provides material for more philosophical descriptions of human nature for example creation as found in the book of genesis provides a theory on human nature catechism of the catholic church under the chapter dignity of the human person provides an article about man as image of god vocation to beatitude freedom human acts passions moral conscience virtues and sin created human nature as originally created the bible describes two elements in human nature the body and the breath or spirit of life breathed into it by god by this was created a living soul meaning a living person according to genesis 1 27 this living person was made in the image of god from the biblical perspective to be human is to bear the image of god 18 genesis does not elaborate the meaning of the image of god but scholars find suggestions one is that being created in the image of god distinguishes human nature from that of the beasts another is that as god is able to make decisions and rule so humans made in god s image are able to make decisions and rule a third is that humankind possesses an inherent ability to set goals and move toward them 5 14 that god denoted creation as good suggests that adam was created in the image of god in righteousness adam was created with ability to make right choices but also with the ability to choose sin by which he fell from righteousness into a state of sin and depravity 231 thus according to the bible humankind is not as god created it fallen human nature by adam s fall into sin human nature became corrupt although it retains the image of god both the old testament and the new testament teach that sin is universal 17 141 for example psalm 51 5 reads for behold i was conceived in iniquities and in sins did my mother conceive me jesus taught that everyone is a sinner naturally because it is humanity s nature and disposition to sin 124 5 paul in romans 7 18 speaks of his sinful nature such a recognition that there is something wrong with the moral nature of man is found in all religions 141 augustine of hippo coined a term for the assessment that all humans are born sinful original sin original sin is the tendency to sin innate in all human beings the doctrine of original sin is held by the catholic church and most mainstream protestant denominations but rejected by the eastern orthodox church which holds the similar doctrine of ancestral fault the corruption of original sin extends to every aspect of human nature to reason and will as well as to appetites and impulses this condition is sometimes called total depravity total depravity does not mean that humanity is as thoroughly depraved as it could become commenting on romans 2 14 john calvin writes that all people have some notions of justice and rectitude which are implanted by nature all people adam embodied the whole of human nature so when adam sinned all of human nature sinned the old testament does not explicitly link the corruption of human nature to adam s sin however the universality of sin implies a link to adam in the new testament paul concurs with the universality of sin he also makes explicit what the old testament implied the link between humanity s sinful nature and adam s sin in romans 5 19 paul writes through adam s disobedience humanity became sinful paul also applied humanity s sinful nature to himself there is nothing good in my sinful nature the theological doctrine of original sin as an inherent element of human nature is not based only on the bible it is in part a generalization from obvious facts open to empirical observation empirical view a number of experts on human nature have described the manifestations of original i e the innate tendency to sin as empirical facts biologist richard dawkins in his the selfish gene states that a predominant quality in a successful surviving gene is ruthless selfishness furthermore this gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior child psychologist burton l white finds a selfish trait in children from birth a trait that expresses itself in actions that are blatantly selfish sociologist william graham sumner finds it a fact that everywhere one meets fraud corruption ignorance selfishness and all the other vices of human nature he enumerates the vices and passions of human nature as cupidity lust vindictiveness ambition and vanity sumner finds such human nature to be universal in all people in all places and in all stations in society psychiatrist thomas anthony harris on the basis of his data at hand observes sin or badness or evil or human nature whatever we call the flaw in our species is apparent in every person harris calls this condition intrinsic badness or original sin empirical discussion questioning the genetic exclusivity of such an intrinsic badness proposition is presented by researchers elliott sober and david sloan wilson in their book unto others the evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior they propose a theory of multilevel group selection in support of an inherent genetic altruism in opposition to the original sin exclusivity for human nature 20th century liberal theology liberal theologians in the early 20th century described human nature as basically good needing only proper training and education but the above examples document the return to a more realistic view of human nature as basically sinful and self centered human nature needs to be regenerated to be able to live the unselfish life regenerated human nature according to the bible adam s disobedience corrupted human nature but god mercifully regenerates regeneration is a radical change that involves a renewal of our human nature thus to counter original sin christianity purposes a complete transformation of individuals by christ the goal of christ s coming is that fallen humanity might be conformed to or transformed into the image of christ who is the perfect image of god as in 2 corinthians 4 4 the new testament makes clear the universal need for regeneration a sampling of biblical portrayals of regenerating human nature and the behavioral results follow being transformed by the renewing of your minds romans 12 2 being transformed from one s old self or old man into a new self or new man colossians 3 9 10 being transformed from people who hate others and are hard to get along with and who are jealous angry and selfish to people who are loving happy peaceful patient kind good faithful gentle and self controlled galatians 5 20 23 being transformed from looking to your own interests to looking to the interests of others philippians 2 4 early modern philosophy although this new realism applied to the study of human life from the beginning for example in machiavelli s works the definitive argument for the final rejection of aristotle was associated especially with francis bacon bacon sometimes wrote as if he accepted the traditional four causes it is a correct position that true knowledge is knowledge by causes and causes again are not improperly distributed into four kinds the material the formal the efficient and the final but he adapted these terms and rejected one of the three but of these the final cause rather corrupts than advances the sciences except such as have to do with human action the discovery of the formal is despaired of the efficient and the material as they are investigated and received that is as remote causes without reference to the latent process leading to the form are but slight and superficial and contribute little if anything to true and active science this line of thinking continued with ren\u00e9 descartes whose new approach returned philosophy or science to its pre socratic focus upon non human things thomas hobbes then giambattista vico and david hume all claimed to be the first to properly use a modern baconian scientific approach to human things hobbes famously followed descartes in describing humanity as matter in motion just like machines he also very influentially described man s natural state without science and artifice as one where life would be solitary poor nasty brutish and short following him john locke s philosophy of empiricism also saw human nature as a tabula rasa in this view the mind is at birth a blank slate without rules so data are added and rules for processing them are formed solely by our sensory experiences jean jacques rousseau pushed the approach of hobbes to an extreme and criticized it at the same time he was a contemporary and acquaintance of hume writing before the french revolution and long before darwin and freud he shocked western civilization with his second discourse by proposing that humans had once been solitary animals without reason or language or communities and had developed these things due to accidents of pre history this proposal was also less famously made by giambattista vico in other words rousseau argued that human nature was not only not fixed but not even approximately fixed compared to what had been assumed before him humans are political and rational and have language now but originally they had none of these things this in turn implied that living under the management of human reason might not be a happy way to live at all and perhaps there is no ideal way to live rousseau is also unusual in the extent to which he took the approach of hobbes asserting that primitive humans were not even naturally social a civilized human is therefore not only imbalanced and unhappy because of the mismatch between civilized life and human nature but unlike hobbes rousseau also became well known for the suggestion that primitive humans had been happier noble savages rousseau s conception of human nature has been seen as the origin of many intellectual and political developments of the 19th and 20th centuries he was an important influence upon kant hegel and marx and the development of german idealism historicism and romanticism what human nature did entail according to rousseau and the other modernists of the 17th and 18th centuries were animal like passions that led humanity to develop language and reasoning and more complex communities or communities of any kind according to rousseau in contrast to rousseau david hume was a critic of the oversimplifying and systematic approach of hobbes rousseau and some others whereby for example all human nature is assumed to be driven by variations of selfishness influenced by hutcheson and shaftesbury he argued against oversimplification on the one hand he accepted that for many political and economic subjects people could be assumed to be driven by such simple selfishness and he also wrote of some of the more social aspects of human nature as something which could be destroyed for example if people did not associate in just societies on the other hand he rejected what he called the paradox of the sceptics saying that no politician could have invented words like honourable and shameful lovely and odious noble and despicable unless there was not some natural original constitution of the mind hume like rousseau was controversial in his own time for his modernist approach following the example of bacon and hobbes of avoiding consideration of metaphysical explanations for any type of cause and effect he was accused of being an atheist he wrote we needn t push our researches so far as to ask why do we have humanity i e a fellow feeling with others it s enough that we experience this as a force in human nature our examination of causes must stop somewhere after rousseau and hume the nature of philosophy and science changed branching into different disciplines and approaches and the study of human nature changed accordingly rousseau s proposal that human nature is malleable became a major influence upon international revolutionary movements of various kinds while hume s approach has been more typical in anglo saxon countries including the united states according to edouard machery the concept of human nature is an outgrowth of folk biology and in particular the concept of folk essentialism the tendency of ordinary people to ascribe essences to kinds machery argues that while the idea that humans have an essence is a very old idea the idea that all humans have a unified human nature is relatively modern for a long time people thought of humans as us versus them and thus did not think of human beings as a unified kind contemporary philosophy the concept of human nature is a source of ongoing debate in contemporary philosophy specifically within philosophy of biology a subfield of the philosophy of science prominent critics of the concept david l hull michael ghiselin and david buller see also argue that human nature is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology conversely defenders of the concept argue that when defined in certain ways human nature is both scientifically respectable and meaningful therefore the value and usefulness of the concept depends essentially on how one construes it this section summarizes the prominent construals of human nature and outlines the key arguments from philosophers on both sides of the debate criticism of the concept of human nature hull philosopher of science david l hull has influentially argued that there is no such thing as human nature hull s criticism is raised against philosophers who conceive human nature as a set of intrinsic phenotypic traits or characters that are universal among humans unique to humans and definitive of what it is to be a member of the biological species homo sapiens in particular hull argues that such essential sameness of human beings is temporary contingent and relatively rare in biology he argues that variation insofar as it is the result of evolution is an essential feature of all biological species moreover the type of variation which characterizes a certain species in a certain historical moment is to a large extent accidental he writes 3 periodically a biological species might be characterized by one or more characters which are both universally distributed among and limited to the organisms belonging to that species but such states of affairs are temporary contingent and relatively rare hull reasons that properties universally shared by all members of a certain species are usually also possessed by members of other species whereas properties exclusively possessed by the members of a certain species are rarely possessed by all members of that species for these reasons hull observes that in contemporary evolutionary taxonomy belonging to a particular species does not depend on the possession of any specific intrinsic properties rather it depends on standing in the right kind of relations relations of genealogy or interbreeding depending on the precise species concept being used to other members of the species consequently there can be no intrinsic properties that define what it is to be a member of the species homo sapiens individual organisms including humans are part of a species by virtue of their relations with other members of the same species not shared intrinsic properties according to hull the moral significance of his argument lies in its impact on the biologically legitimate basis for the concept of human rights while it has long been argued that there is a sound basis for human rights in the idea that all human beings are essentially the same should hull s criticism work such a basis at least on a biological level would disappear nevertheless hull does not perceive this to be a fundamental for human rights because people can choose to continue respecting human rights even without sharing the same human nature defences of the concept of human nature several contemporary philosophers have attempted to defend the notion of human nature against charges that it is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology by proposing alternative interpretations they claim that the concept of human nature continues to bear relevance in the fields of neuroscience and evolutionary biology many have proposed non essentialist notions others have argued that even if natural selection has shown that any attempt to base species membership on intrinsic essential properties is untenable essences can still be relational this would be consistent with the interbreeding ecological and phylogenetic species concepts which are accepted by modern evolutionary biology these attempts aim to make natural selection compatible with a certain conception of human nature which is stable across time nomological account machery philosopher of science edouard machery has proposed that the above criticisms only apply to a specific definition or notion of human nature and not to human nature in general he distinguishes between two different notions an essentialist notion of human nature human nature is the set of properties that are separately necessary and jointly sufficient for being a human these properties are also usually considered as distinctive of human beings they are also intrinsic to humans and inherent to their essence a nomological notion of human nature human nature is the set of properties that humans tend to possess as a result of the evolution of their species machery clarifies that to count as being a result of evolution a property must have an ultimate explanation in ernst mayr s sense it must be possible to explain the trait as the product of evolutionary processes importantly properties can count as part of human nature in the nomological sense even if they are not universal among humans and not unique to humans in other words nomological properties need not be necessary nor sufficient for being human instead it is enough that these properties are shared by most humans as a result of the evolution of their species they need to be typical therefore human nature in the nomological sense does not define what it is to be a member of the species homo sapiens examples of properties that count as parts of human nature on the nomological definition include being bipedal having the capacity to speak having a tendency towards biparental investment in children having fear reactions to unexpected noises finally since they are the product of evolution properties belonging to the nomological notion of human nature are not fixed but they can change over time machery agrees with biologists and others philosophers of biology that the essentialist notion of human nature is incompatible with modern evolutionary biology we cannot explain membership in the human species by means of a definition or a set of properties however he maintains that this does not mean humans have no nature because we can accept the nomological notion which is not a definitional notion therefore we should think of human nature as the many properties humans have in common as a result of evolution machery argues that notions of human nature can help explain why that while cultures are very diverse there are also many constants across cultures for machery most forms of cultural diversity are in fact diversity on a common theme for example machery observes that the concept of a kinship system is common across cultures but the exact form it takes and the specifics vary between cultures problems with the nomological account machery also highlights potential drawbacks of the nomological account one is that the nomological notion is a watered down notion that cannot perform many of the roles that the concept of human nature is expected to perform in science and philosophy the properties endowed upon humans by the nomological account do not distinguish humans from other animals or define what it is to be human machery pre empts this objection by claiming that the nomological concept of human nature still fulfils many roles he highlights the importance of a conception which picks out what humans share in common which can be used to make scientific psychological generalizations about human beings one advantage of such a conception is that it gives an idea of the traits displayed by the majority of human beings which can be explained in evolutionary terms another potential drawback is that the nomological account of human nature threatens to lead to the absurd conclusion that all properties of humans are parts of human nature according to the nomological account a trait is only part of human nature if it is a result of evolution however there is a sense in which all human traits are results of evolution for example the belief that water is wet is shared by all humans however this belief is only possible because we have for example evolved a sense of touch it is difficult to separate traits which are the result of evolution and those which are not machery claims the distinction between proximate and ultimate explanation can do the work here only some human traits can be given an ultimate explanation he argues according to the philosopher richard samuels the account of human nature is expected to fulfill the five following roles an organizing function that demarks a territory of scientific inquiry a descriptive function that is traditionally understood as specifying properties that are universal across and unique to human being a causal explanatory function that offers causal explanation for occurring human behaviours and features a taxonomic function that specifies possessing human nature as a necessary and sufficient criterion for belonging to the human species invariances that assume the understanding that human nature is to some degree fixed invariable or at least hard to change and stable across time samuels objects that machery s nomological account fails to deliver on the causal explanatory function because it claims that superficial and co varying properties are the essence of human nature thus human nature cannot be the underlying cause of these properties and accordingly cannot fulfill its causal explanatory role philosopher grant ramsey also rejects machery s nomological account for him defining human nature with respect to only universal traits fails to capture many important human characteristics ramsey quotes the anthropologist clifford geertz who claims that the notion that unless a cultural phenomenon is empirically universal it cannot reflect anything about the nature of man is about as logical as the notion that because sickle cell anemia is fortunately not universal it cannot tell us anything about human genetic processes it is not whether phenomena are empirically common that is critical in science but whether they can be made to reveal the enduring natural processes that underly them following geertz ramsey holds that the study of human nature should not rely exclusively on universal or near universal traits there are many idiosyncratic and particular traits of scientific interest machery s account of human nature cannot give an account to such differences between men and women as the nomological account only picks out the common features within a species in this light the female menstrual cycle which is a biologically an essential and useful feature cannot be included in a nomological account of human nature ramsey also objects that machery uncritically adopts the innate acquired dichotomy distinguishing between human properties due to enculturation and those due to evolution ramsey objects that human properties do not just fall in one of the two categories writing that any organismic property is going to be due to both heritable features of the organism as well as the particular environmental features the organism happens to encounter during its life causal essentialist account samuels richard samuels in an article titled science and human nature proposes a causal essentialist view that human nature should be identified with a suite of mechanisms processes and structures that causally explain many of the more superficial properties and regularities reliably associated with humanity this view is causal because the mechanisms causally explain the superficial properties reliably associated with humanity by referencing the underlying causal structures the properties belong to for example it is true that the belief that water is wet is shared by all humans yet it is not in itself a significant aspect of human nature instead the psychological process that lead us to assign the word wetness to water is a universal trait shared by all human beings in this respect the superficial belief that water is wet reveals an important causal psychological process which is widely shared by most human beings the explanation is also essentialist because there is a core set of empirically discoverable cognitive mechanism that count as part of the human nature according to samuels his view avoids the standard biological objections to human nature essentialism samuels argues that the theoretical roles of human nature includes organizing role descriptive functions causal explanatory functions taxonomic functions and invariances in comparison with traditional essentialist view the causal essentialist view does not accomplish the taxonomic role of human nature the role of defining what it is to be human he claims however that no conception could achieve this as the fulfillment of the role would not survive evolutionary biologists objections articulated above by in criticisms of the concept of human nature in comparison with machery s nomological conception samuels wants to restore the causal explanatory function of human nature he defines the essence of human nature as causal mechanisms and not as surface level properties for instance on this view linguistic behaviour is not part of human nature but the cognitive mechanisms underpinning linguistic behaviour might count as part of human nature life history trait cluster account ramsey grant ramsey proposes an alternative account of human nature which he names the life history trait cluster account this view stems from the recognition that the combination of a specific genetic constitution with a specific environment is not sufficient to determine how a life will go i e whether one is rich poor dies old dies young etc many life histories are possible for a given individual each populated by a great number of traits ramsey defines his conception of human nature in reference to the pattern of trait clusters within the totality of extant possible life histories in other words there are certain life histories i e possible routes one s life can take for example being rich being a phd student or getting ill ramsey underlines the patterns behind these possible routes by delving into the causes of these life histories for example one can make the following claim humans sweat when they get exhausted or one can also propose neurological claims such as humans secrete adrenaline when they are in flight fight mode this approach enables ramsey to go beyond the superficial appearances and understand the similarities differences between individuals in a deeper level which refers to the causal mechanisms processes structures and constraints etc which lie beneath them once we list all the possible life histories of an individual we can find these causal patterns and add them together to form the basis of individual nature ramsey s next argumentative manoeuvre is to point out that traits are not randomly scattered across potential life histories there are patterns these patterns he states provide the basis for the notion of individual and human nature 987 while one s individual nature consists of the pattern of trait clusters distributed across that individual s set of possible life histories human nature ramsey defines as the pattern of trait clusters within the totality of extant human possible life histories 987 thus if we were to combine all possible life histories of all individuals in existence we would have access to the trait distribution patterns that constitute human nature trait patterns on ramsey s account can be captured in the form of conditional statements such as if female you develop ovaries or if male you develop testes these statements will not be true of all humans ramsey contends that these statements capture part of human nature if they have a good balance of pervasiveness many people satisfy the antecedent of the conditional statement and robustness many people who satisfy the antecedent go on to satisfy the consequent scientific understanding the hereditarian paradigm instinctual behaviour instinctual behaviour an inherent inclination towards a particular complex behaviour has been observed in humans emotions such as fear are part of human nature see fear innate fear for example however they are also known to have been malleable and not fixed see neuroplasticity and fear inability to experience fear congenital fear of snakes and spiders was found in six month old babies infant cry is a manifestation of instinct the infant cannot otherwise protect itself for survival during its long period of maturation the maternal instinct manifest particularly in response to the infant cry has long been respected as one of the most powerful its mechanism has been partly elucidated by observations with functional mri of the mother s brain the herd instinct is found in human children and chimpanzee cubs but is apparently absent in young orangutans squeamishness and disgust in humans is an instinct developed during evolution to protect the body and avoid infection by various diseases socioeconomic context the socioeconomic environment of humans are a context which affect their brain development it has been argued that h sapiens is unsustainable by nature that unsustainability is an inevitable emergent property of his unaltered nature it has also been argued that human nature is not necessarily resulting in unsustainability but is embedded in and affected by a socioeconomic system that is not having an inevitable structure that the contemporary socioeconomic macrosystem affects human activities a paper published in 1997 concluded that humanity suffer consequences of a poor fit between inherited natures and many of the constructed environments in organizational society designing a cultural narrative explicitly for living on a finite planet may be suitable for overriding outdated innate tendencies human nature which some have argued to vary to some extent per individual and in time not be static and at least in the future to some extent be purposely alterable is one of the factors that shape which how and when human activities are conducted the contemporary socioeconomic and collective decision making mechanisms are structures that may affect the expression of human nature for instance innate tendencies to seek survival well being respect and status that some consider fundamental to humans may result in varying product designs types of work public infrastructure designs and the distribution and prevalence of each as with the nature versus nurture debate which is concerned whether or to which degrees human behavior is determined by the environment or by a person s genes scientific research is inconclusive about the degree to which human nature is shaped by and manageable by systemic structures as well as about how and to which degrees these structures can and should be purposely altered swiftly

traveled by a car or a motorcycle history first road trips by automobile the world s first recorded long distance road trip by the automobile took place in germany in august 1888 when bertha benz the wife of karl benz the inventor of the first patented motor car the benz patent motorwagen traveled from mannheim to pforzheim a distance of 106 km 66 mi in the third experimental benz motor car which had a maximum speed of 10 kilometres per hour 6 2 mph and back with her two teenage sons richard and eugen but without the consent and knowledge of her husband her official reason was that she wanted to visit her mother but unofficially she intended to generate publicity for her husband s invention which had only been used on short test drives before which succeeded as the automobile took off greatly afterward and the benz s family business eventually evolved into the present day mercedes benz company presently there is a dedicated signposted scenic route in baden w\u00fcrttemberg called the bertha benz memorial route to commemorate her historic first road trip early road trips in north america the first successful north american transcontinental trip by automobile took place in 1903 and was piloted by h nelson jackson and sewall k crocker accompanied by a dog named bud the trip was completed using a 1903 winton touring car dubbed vermont by jackson the trip took 63 days between san francisco and new york costing us 8 000 the total cost included items such as food gasoline lodging tires parts other supplies and the cost of the winton the ocean to ocean automobile endurance contest was a road trip from new york city to seattle in june 1909 the winning car took 23 days to complete the trip the first woman to cross the american landscape by car was alice huyler ramsey with three female passengers in 1909 ramsey left from hell s gate in manhattan new york and traveled 59 days to san francisco california ramsey was followed in 1910 by blanche stuart scott who is often mistakenly cited as the first woman to make the cross country journey by automobile east to west but was a true pioneer in aviation the 1919 motor transport corps convoy was a road trip by approximately 300 united states army personnel from washington dc to san francisco dwight eisenhower was a participant 81 vehicles began the trip which took 62 days to complete overcoming numerous mechanical and road condition problems eisenhower s report about this trip led to an understanding that improving cross country highways was important to national security and economic development expansion of highways in the united states new highways in the early 20th century helped propel automobile travel in the united states primarily cross country commissioned in 1926 and completely paved near the end of the 1930s u s route 66 is a living icon of early modern road tripping motorists ventured cross country for holidays as well as migrating to california and other locations the modern american road trip began to take shape in the late 1930s and into the 1940s ushering in an era of a nation on the move the 1950s saw the rapid growth of ownership of automobiles by american families the automobile now a trusted mode of transportation was being widely used for not only commuting but leisure trips as well as a result of this new vacation by road style many businesses began to cater to road weary travelers more reliable vehicles and services made long distance road trips easier for families as the length of time required to cross the continent was reduced from months to days the average family can travel to destinations across north america in one week for example maryland journalist kevin james shay drove his two kids preston and mckenna across the united states and back in roughly two weeks in 2013 visiting the grand canyon mount rushmore and other top attractions during the 6 950 mile trip the biggest change to the american road trip was the start and subsequent expansion of the interstate highway system the higher speeds and controlled access nature of the interstate allowed for greater distances to be traveled in less time and with improved safety as highways became divided travelers from european countries australia and elsewhere soon came to the united states to take part in the american ideal of a road trip canadians also engaged in road trips

in 1994 of just under five days and they were mentioned in the guinness book of records after others beat that time lowe and his partners again eclipsed the record in 2019 driving 6 619 miles through the 48 states in just under four days possible motivations many people may go on road trips for recreational purpose e g sightseeing or to reach a desired location typically during a vacation period e

some cases costumed adventurer or superhuman adventurer as a synonym for super hero outdoors adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or mother nature examples include books such as hatchet or my side of the mountain these books are less about questing such as in mythology or other adventure novels but more about surviving on their own living off the land gaining new experiences and becoming closer to the natural world questing many adventures are based on the idea of a quest the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward whether it be a skill prize treasure or perhaps the safety of a person on the way the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain their reward video games in video game culture an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle solving the genre s focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative based media literature and film encompassing a wide variety of literary genres many adventure games text and graphic are designed for a single player since this emphasis on story and character makes multi player design difficult nonfiction works from ancient times travelers and explorers have written about their adventures journals which became best sellers in their day were written such as marco polo s journal the travels of marco polo or mark twain s roughing it others were personal journals only later published such as the journals of meriwether lewis and william clark or captain james cook s journals there are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question such as the right stuff by tom wolfe or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal such as conquistadors of the useless by lionel terray documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well adventure sports there are many sports classified as adventure sports due to their inherent danger and excitement some of these include mountain climbing skydiving or other extreme sports see also adventure film adventure playground adventure travel

boat bus airplane ship or other means with or without luggage and can be one way or round trip travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements as in the case of tourism etymology the origin of the word travel is most likely lost to history the term travel may originate from the old french word travail which means work according to the merriam webster dictionary the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century it also states that the word comes from middle english travailen travelen which means to torment labor strive journey and earlier from old french travailler which means to work strenuously toil in english people still occasionally use the words travail which means struggle according to simon winchester in his book the best travelers tales 2004 the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient root a roman instrument of torture called the tripalium in latin it means three stakes as in to impale this link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times travel in modern times may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination travel to mount everest the amazon rainforest extreme tourism and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel such as by bus cruise ship or even by bullock cart purpose and motivation reasons for traveling include recreation holidays rejuvenation tourism or vacationing research travel the gathering of information visiting people volunteer travel for charity migration to begin life somewhere else religious pilgrimages and mission trips business travel trade commuting obtaining health care waging or fleeing war for the enjoyment of traveling or other reasons travelers may use human powered transport such as walking or bicycling or vehicles such as public transport automobiles trains ferries boats cruise ships and airplanes motives for travel include pleasure relaxation discovery and exploration adventure intercultural communications taking personal time for building interpersonal relationships avoiding stress forming memories cultural experiences volunteering festivals and events history travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy greeks and romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as pompeii and baiae while early travel tended to be slower more dangerous and more dominated by trade and migration cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible humankind has come a long way in transportation since christopher columbus sailed to the new world from spain in 1492 an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination to the 21st century when aircraft allows travel from spain to the united states overnight travel in the middle ages offered hardships and challenges though it was important to the economy and to society the wholesale sector depended for example on merchants dealing with through caravans or sea voyagers end user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet gyrovagues wandering monks and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas traveling minstrels toured and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars pilgrimages were common in both the european and islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally and internationally in the late 16th century it became fashionable for young european aristocrats and wealthy upper class men to travel to significant european cities as part of their education in the arts and literature this was known as the grand tour and included cities such as london paris venice florence and rome however the french revolution brought with it the end of the grand tour travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land travel at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task this was capitalized on by people like thomas cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long distance surface travel in the 20th century notably after the second world war where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman alexis alford visited all 196 countries before the age of 21 geographic types travel may be local regional national domestic or international in some countries non local internal travel may require an internal passport while international travel typically requires a passport and visa tours are a common type of travel examples of travel tours are expedition cruises small group tours and river cruises safety authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety when traveling abroad the odds favor a safe and incident free trip however travelers can be subject to difficulties crime and violence some safety considerations include being aware of one s surroundings avoiding being the target of a crime leaving copies of one s passport and itinerary information with trusted people obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited and registering with one s national embassy when arriving in a foreign country many countries do not recognize drivers licenses from other countries however most countries accept international driving permits automobile insurance policies issued in one s own country are often invalid in foreign countries and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited it is also advisable to become oriented with the driving rules and regulations of destination countries wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws there are three main statistics which may be used to compare the safety of various forms of travel based on a department of the environment transport and the regions survey in october 2000 see also references external links travel merriam webster com dictionary merriam webster", "Infatuation": "infatuation also known as being smitten is the personal state of being overly driven by an uninformed or otherwise unreasonable passion usually towards another person for whom one has developed strong romantic or sexual feelings psychologist frank d cox said that infatuation could be distinguished from romantic love only when looking back on a particular case of being attracted to a person but which may also evolve into a mature love goldstein and brandon describe infatuation as the first stage of a relationship before developing into a mature intimacy whereas love is a warm attachment enthusiasm or devotion to another person infatuation is a feeling of foolish or obsessively strong love for admiration for or interest in someone or something a shallower honeymoon phase in a relationship ian kerner a sex therapist stated that infatuation usually occurred at the beginning of relationships which is marked by a sense of excitement and euphoria and it s often accompanied by lust and a feeling of newness and rapid expansion with a person the psychologist adam phillips has described how illusions that occurred during infatuation inevitably resulted in disappointment when learning the truth about a lover adolescents often make people an object of extravagant short lived passion or temporary love youth it is customary to view young people s dating relationships and first relationships as puppy love or infatuation and if infatuation is both an early stage in a deepening sequence of love attachment and at the same time a potential stopping point it is perhaps no surprise that it is a condition especially prevalent in the first youthful explorations of the world of relationships thus the first passionate adoration of a youth for a celebrated actress whom he regards as far above him to whom he scarcely dares lift his bashful eyes may be seen as part of an infatuation with celebrity especially perilous with the young admiration plays a significant part in this as in the case of a schoolgirl crush on a boy or on a male teacher the girl starts off admiring the teacher then may get hung up on the teacher and follow him around then there may be shame at being confronted with the fact that you ve got what s called a crush on him think if someone was hanging around you pestering and sighing of course sex may come into this with an infatuated schoolgirl or schoolboy as well producing the stricken gaze a compulsive movement of the throat an i m lying down and i don t care if you walk on me babe expression of infatuation such a cocktail of emotions may even falsify the erotic sense of reality when a person in love estimates his partner s virtues he is usually not very realistic projection of all his ideals onto the partner s personality it is this projection that differentiates infatuation from love according to the spiritual teacher meher baba in infatuation the person is a passive victim of the spell of conceived attraction for the object in love there is an active appreciation of the intrinsic worth of the object of love distance from the object of infatuation as with celebrities can help maintain the infatuated state a time honoured cure for the one who has a tendre infatuated is to have thrown them continually together by doing so you will cure or you will know that it is not an infatuation the possible effects of infatuation and love relationships on the academic behaviour of adolescent students were examined in research the outcome shows that most of the participants had distraction stress and poor academic performance as a result of love relationships and infatuation furthermore the findings highlighted that this has a detrimental effect on learning behaviour among teenagers who are in romantic or infatuated relationships types three types of infatuation have been identified by brown the first type is characterized by being carried away without insight or proper evaluative judgement by blind desire the second closely related by being compelled by a desire or craving over which the agent has no control while the agent s evaluation may well be sound although the craving or love remains unaffected by it and the third is that of the agent who exhibits bad judgement and misvaluation for reasons such as ignorance or recklessness in transference in psychoanalysis a sign that the method is taking hold is the initial infatuation to be observed at the beginning of treatment the beginning of transference the patient in freud s words develops a special interest in the person of the doctor never tires in his home of praising the doctor and of extolling ever new qualities in him what occurs it is usually maintained is a sort of false love a shadow of love replicating in its course the infatuations of what is called true love however psychoanalyst janet malcolm claims that it is wrong to convince the patient that their love is an illusion that it s not you she loves freud was off base when he wrote that it is you who else could it be thereby taking the question of what is called true love further than it had ever been taken conversely in countertransference the therapist may become infatuated with his her client very good looking she was the most gratifying of patients she made literary allusions and understood the ones he made he was dazzled by her a little in love with her after two years the analysis ground down to a horrible halt intellectual infatuations infatuations need not only involve people but can extend to objects activities and ideas men are always falling in love with other men with their war heroes and sport heroes with institutions discourses and role models thus for example jung s initial unconditional devotion to freud s theories and his no less unconditional veneration of freud s person was seen at the time by both men as a quasi religious infatuation to a cult object while freud in turn was very attracted by jung s personality perhaps saw in jung an idealized version of himself a mutual admiration society intellectually infatuated with one another but there are also collective infatuations we are all prone to being drawn into social phantasy systems thus for instance the recent intellectual infatuation with structuralism and post structuralism arguably lasted at least until september 11 ended intellectual infatuation with postmodernism as a whole economic bubbles thrive on collective infatuations of a different kind all boom bust processes contain an element of misunderstanding or misconception whether it is the infatuation with becoming the latest dot com billionaire or the one that followed with subprime mortgages once greenspan had replaced the tech bubble with a housing bubble as markets swung virtually overnight from euphoria to fear in the credit crunch even the most hardened market fundamentalist had to concede that such periodic surges of euphoria and fear are manifestations of deep seated aspects of human nature whether these are enacted in home room infatuations or upon the global stage literary depictions shakespeare s sonnets have been described as a poetics for infatuation as being dominated by one theme and that theme is infatuation its initiation cultivation and history together with its peaks of triumph and devastation a lengthy exploration of the condition of being subject to the appropriate disorders that belong to our infatuation the condition of infatuation in ivan turgenev s first love a novella from 1860 16 year old woldemar becomes

christian passio passion suffering denotes strong and intractable or barely controllable emotion or inclination with respect to a particular person or thing passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea proposal or cause to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity to strong attraction excitement or emotion towards a person it is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term lust often incorporating ideas of ecstasy and or suffering denis diderot 1713 1784 describes passions as penchants inclinations desires and aversions carried to a certain degree of intensity combined with an indistinct sensation of pleasure or pain occasioned or accompanied by some irregular movement of the blood and animal spirits are what we call passions they can be so strong as to inhibit all practice of personal freedom a state in which the soul is in some sense rendered passive whence the name passions this inclination or so called disposition of the soul is born of the opinion we hold that a great good or a great evil is contained in an object which in and of itself arouses passion diderot further breaks down pleasure and pain which he sees as the guiding principles of passion into four major categories pleasures and pains of the senses pleasures of the mind or of the imagination our perfection or our imperfection of virtues or vices pleasures and pains in the happiness or misfortunes of others modern pop psychologies and employers tend to favor and even encourage the expression of a passion previous generations sometimes expressed more nuanced viewpoints emotion the standard definition for emotion is a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one s circumstances mood or relationships with others emotion william james describes emotions as corporeal reverberations such as surprise curiosity rapture fear anger lust greed and the like these are all feelings that affect our mental perception our body is placed into this latter state which is caused by one s mental affection this state gives signals to our body which cause bodily expressions the philosopher robert solomon developed his own theory and definition of emotion his view is that emotion is not a bodily state but instead a type of judgment it is necessary that we choose our emotions in much the same way that we choose our actions with regard to the relationship between emotion and our rational will solomon believes that people are responsible for their emotions emotions are rational and purposive just as actions are we choose an emotion much as we choose a course of action recent studies also traditional studies have placed emotions to be a physiological disturbance william james takes such consciousness of emotion to be not a choice but a physical occurrence rather than a disturbance it is an occurrence that happens outside of our control and our bodies are just affected by these emotions we produce these actions based on the instinctive state that these feelings lead us towards this concept of emotion was derived from passion emotions were created as a category within passion reason strong desire for something in whatever context if someone desires for something and that desire has some strong feeling or emotion is defined in terms of passion passion has no boundary being passionate about something which is boundless can be sometimes dangerous in which person forget about everything and is fully determined towards the particular thing sanyukta in his wake stoics like epictetus emphasized that the most important and especially pressing field of study is that which has to do with the stronger emotions sorrows lamentations envies passions which make it impossible for us even to listen to reason the stoic tradition still lay behind hamlet s plea to give me that man that is not passion s slave and i will wear him in my heart s core or erasmus s lament that jupiter has bestowed far more passion than reason you could calculate the ratio as 24 to one it was only with the romantic movement that a valorisation of passion over reason took hold in the western tradition the more passion there is the better the poetry the recent concerns of emotional intelligence have been to find a synthesis of the two forces something that turns the old understanding of the tension between reason and feeling on its head it is not that we want to do away with emotion and put reason in its place as erasmus had it but instead find the intelligent balance of the two descartes error antonio damasio studied what ensued when something severed ties between the lower centres of the emotional brain and the thinking abilities of the neocortex he found that while emotions and feelings can cause havoc in the processes of reasoning the absence of emotion and feeling is no less damaging and was led to the counter intuitive position that feelings are typically indispensable for rational decisions the passions he concluded have a say on how the rest of the brain and cognition go about their business their influence is immense providing a frame of reference as opposed to descartes error the cartesian idea of a disembodied mind in marriage a tension or dialectic between marriage and passion can be traced back in western society at least as far as the middle ages and the emergence of the cult of courtly love denis de rougemont has argued that since its origins in the twelfth century passionate love was constituted in opposition to marriage stacey oliker writes that while puritanism prepared the ground for a marital love ideology by prescribing love in marriage only from the eighteenth century has romantic love ideology resolved the puritan antagonism between passion and reason in a marital context note though that saint paul spoke of loving one s wife in ephesians 5 intellectual passions george bernard shaw insists that there are passions far more exciting than the physical ones intellectual passion mathematical passion passion for discovery and exploration the mightiest of all passions his contemporary sigmund freud argued for a continuity not a contrast between the two physical and intellectual and commended the way leonardo da vinci had energetically sublimated his sexual passions into the passion for independent scientific research as a motivation in an occupation there are different reasons individuals are motivated in an occupation these may include a passion for the occupation for a firm or for an activity when canadian managers or professionals score as passionate about their occupation they tend to be less obsessive about their behavior while on their job resulting in more work being done and more work satisfaction these same individuals have higher levels of psychological well being when people genuinely enjoy their profession and are motivated by their passion they tend to be more satisfied with their work and more psychologically healthy when managers or professionals are unsatisfied with their profession they tend to also be dissatisfied with their family relationships and to experience psychological distress other reasons people are more satisfied when they are motivated by their passion for their occupation include the effects of intrinsic and external motivations when canadian managers or professionals do a job to satisfy others they tend to have lower levels of satisfaction and psychological health also these same individuals have shown they are motivated by several beliefs and fears concerning other people thirdly though some individuals believe one should not work extreme hours many prefer it because of how passionate they are about the occupation on the other hand this may also put a strain on family relationships and friendships the balance of the two is something that is hard to achieve and it is always hard to satisfy both parties work enjoyment vs inner pressures there are different components that qualify as reasons for considering an individual as a workaholic burke fiksenbaum refer to spence and robbins 1992 by stating two of the three workaholism components that are used to measure workaholism these include feeling driven to work because of inner pressure and work enjoyment both of these affect an individual differently and each has different outcomes to begin work enjoyment brings about more positive work outcomes and is unrelated to health indicators inner pressure on the other hand is negatively related with work outcomes and has been related negatively to measures of psychological health burke fiksenbaum make a reference to graves et al 2006 when examining work enjoyment and inner pressures work enjoyment and inner pressure were tested with performance ratings the former was positively related to performance ratings while the latter interfered with the performance enhancing aspects of work enjoyment burke fiksenbaum refer to virick and baruch 2007 when explaining how these two workaholism components affect life satisfaction not surprisingly inner pressure lowered the balance between work life and life satisfaction but enhanced people s performance at their occupation whereas work enjoyment led to a positive balance between the two again when managers and professionals are passionate about their occupation and put in many hours they then become concerned that their occupation will satisfy personal relationships and the balance must then be found according to the importance levels of the individual motivation and outcomes the researchers indicate different patterns of correlations between these two components these patterns include antecedents and consequences the two components offer unique motivations or orientations to work which result in its effects on work and well being inner pressures will hinder performance while work enjoyment will smooth performance inner pressures of workaholism have characteristics such as persistence rigidity perfectionism and heightened levels of job stress this component is also associated with working harder not smarter on a more positive note individuals who enjoy their work will have higher levels of performance for several reasons these include creativity trust in their colleagues and reducing levels of stress good and bad workaholics burke and fiksenbaum refer to schaufeli taris and bakker 2007 when they made a distinction between an individual good workaholics and bad workaholics a good workaholic will score higher on measures of work engagement and a bad workaholic will score higher on measures of burnout they mentioned above also suggest why this is some individuals work because they are satisfied engaged and challenged and to prove a point on the other hand the opposite kind work hard because they are addicted to work they see that the occupation makes a contribution to finding an identity and purpose desire in an occupation passion and desire go hand in hand especially as a motivation linstead brewis refer to merriam webster to say that passion is an intense driving or overmastering feeling or conviction this suggests that passion is a very intense emotion but can be positive or negative negatively it may be unpleasant at times it could involve pain and has obsessive forms that can destroy the self and even others in an occupation when an individual is very passionate about their job they may be so wrapped up in work that they cause pain to their loved ones by focusing more on their job than on their friendships and relationships this is a constant battle of balance that is difficult to achieve and only an individual can decide where that line lies passion is connected to the concept of desire in fact they are inseparable according to a mostly western way of thinking related to plato aristotle and augustine these two concepts cause individuals to reach out for something or even someone they both can either be creative or destructive and this dark side can very well be dangerous to the self or to others as a motivation for hobbies hobbies require a certain level of passion in order to continue engaging in the hobby singers athletes dancers artists and many others describe their emotion for their hobby as a passion although this might be the emotion they re feeling passion is serving as a motivation for them to continue their hobby recently there has been a model to explain different types of passion that contribute to engaging in an activity dualistic model according to researchers who have tested this model a dualistic model in which passion is defined as a strong inclination or desire toward a self defining activity that one likes or even loves that one finds important high valuation and in which one invests time and energy it is proposed that there exist two types of passion the first type of passion is harmonious passion a harmonious passion refers to a strong desire to engage in the activity that remains under the person s control this is mostly obtained when the person views their activity as part of their identity furthermore once an activity is part of the person s identity then the motivation to continue the specific hobby is even stronger the harmony obtained with this passion is conceived when the person is able both to freely engage in or to stop the hobby it s not so much that the person is forced to continue this hobby but on his or her own free will is able to engage in it for example if a girl loves to play volleyball but she has a project due the next day and her friends invite her to play she should be able to say no on the basis of her own free will the second kind of passion in the dualistic model is obsessive passion being the opposite of harmonious passion this type has a strong desire to engage in the activity but it s not under the person s own control and he or she is forced to engage in the hobby this type of passion has a negative effect on a person where they could feel they need to engage in their hobby to continue for example interpersonal relationships or fit in with the crowd to change the above example if the girl has an obsessive passion towards volleyball and she is asked to play with her friends she will likely say yes even though she needs to finish her project for the next day intrinsic motivation since passion can be a type of motivation in hobbies then assessing intrinsic motivation is appropriate intrinsic motivation helps define these types of passion passion naturally helps the needs or desires that motivate a person to some particular action or behavior certain abilities and hobbies can be developed early and the innate motivation is also something that comes early in life although someone might know how to engage in a hobby this does not necessarily mean they are motivated to do it christine robinson makes the point in her article that knowledge of your innate motivation can help guide action toward what will be fulfilling feeling satisfied and fulfilled builds the passion for the hobby to continue a person s happiness fictional examples in margaret drabble s the realms of gold the hero flies hundreds of miles to reunite with the heroine only to miss her by 24 hours leaving the onlookers wondering what grand passion could have brought him so far a quixotic look about him a look of harassed desperation when the couple do finally reunite however the heroine is less than impressed if you ask me it was a very childish gesture you re not twenty one now you know no i know it was my last fling in alberto moravia s 1934 the revolutionary double agent faced with the girl he is betraying was seized by violent desire he never took his eyes off my bosom i believe those two dark spots at the end of my breasts were enough to make him forget tsarism revolution political faith

contentment to intense joy it is often associated with positive life experiences such as achieving goals spending time with loved ones or engaging in enjoyable activities however happiness can also arise spontaneously without any apparent external cause happiness is closely linked to well being and overall life satisfaction studies have shown that individuals who experience higher levels of happiness tend to have better physical and mental health stronger social relationships and greater resilience in the face of adversity the pursuit of happiness has been a central theme in philosophy and psychology for centuries while there is no single universally accepted definition of happiness it is generally understood to be a state of mind characterized by positive emotions a sense of purpose and a feeling of fulfillment definitions happiness is subject to debate on usage and meaning and on possible differences in understanding by culture the word is mostly used in relation to two factors the current experience of the feeling of an emotion affect such as pleasure or joy or of a more general sense of emotional condition as a whole for instance daniel kahneman has defined happiness as what i experience here and now this usage is prevalent in dictionary definitions of happiness appraisal of life satisfaction such as of quality of life for instance ruut veenhoven has defined happiness as overall appreciation of one s life as a whole 2 happiness is often used in ordinary life to refer to a short lived state of a person frequently a feeling of contentment you look happy today i m very happy for you philosophically its scope is more often wider encompassing a whole life and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person s life or of their happy life even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable the point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one even though they lacked contentment but this usage is uncommon and may cause confusion kahneman has said that this is more important to people than current experience some usages can include both of these factors subjective well being swb includes measures of current experience emotions moods and feelings and of life satisfaction for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as the experience of joy contentment or positive well being combined with a sense that one s life is good meaningful and worthwhile eudaimonia is a greek term variously translated as happiness welfare flourishing and blessedness xavier landes has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective well being mood and eudaimonia these differing uses can give different results whereas nordic countries often score highest on swb surveys south american countries score higher on affect based surveys of current positive life experiencing the implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context qualifying happiness as a polyseme and a fuzzy concept a further issue is when measurement is made appraisal of a level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date some users accept these issues but continue to use the word because of its convening power happiness vs joy german philosophy professor michela summa says that the distinction between joy and happiness is that joy accompanies the process through and through whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one s life or one s own life as a whole measurement people have been trying to measure happiness for centuries in 1780 the english utilitarian philosopher jeremy bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing today happiness is typically measured using self report surveys self reporting is prone to cognitive biases and other sources of errors such as peak end rule studies show that memories of felt emotions can be inaccurate affective forecasting research shows that people are poor predictors of their future emotions including how happy they will be happiness economists are not overly concerned with philosophical and methodological issues and continue to use questionaries to measure average happiness of populations several scales have been developed to measure happiness the subjective happiness scale shs is a four item scale measuring global subjective happiness from 1999 the scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals the positive and negative affect schedule panas from 1988 is a 20 item questionnaire using a five point likert scale 1 very slightly or not at all 5 extremely to assess the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at this moment today the past few days the past week the past few weeks the past year and in general a longer version with additional affect scales was published 1994 the satisfaction with life scale swls is a global cognitive assessment of life satisfaction developed by ed diener a seven point likert scale is used to agree or disagree with five statements about one s life the cantril ladder method has been used in the world happiness report respondents are asked to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 they are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale positive experience the survey by gallup asks if the day before people experienced enjoyment laughing or smiling a lot feeling well rested

with your life as a whole and in emotional reports as in how happy are you now and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts using these measures the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness in subjective well being measures the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports the uk began to measure national well being in 2012 following bhutan which had already been measuring gross national happiness academic economists and international economic organizations are arguing for and developing multi dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing there are many different contributors to adult wellbeing such as the point that happiness judgements partly reflect the presence of salient constraints and that fairness autonomy community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course although these factors play a role in happiness they do not all need to improve simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness happiness has been found to be quite stable over time genetics and heritability as of 2016 no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found the topic is being researched at the lee kum sheung center for health and happiness at the harvard t h chan school of public health a positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain s gray matter in the right precuneus area and one s subjective happiness score sonja lyubomirsky has estimated that 50 percent of a given human s happiness level could be genetically determined 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self control when discussing genetics and their effects on individuals it is important to first understand that genetics do not predict behavior it is possible for genes to increase the likelihood of individuals being happier compared to others but they do not 100 percent predict behavior at this point in scientific research it has been hard to find a lot of evidence to support this idea that happiness is affected in some way by genetics in a 2016 study michael minkov and michael harris bond found that a gene by the name of slc6a4 was not a good predictor of happiness level in humans on the other hand there have been many studies that have found genetics to be a key part in predicting and understanding happiness in humans in a review article discussing many studies on genetics and happiness they discussed the common findings the author found an important factor that has affected scientist findings this being how happiness is measured for example in certain studies when subjective wellbeing is measured as a trait heredity is found to be higher about 70 to 90 percent in another study 11 500 unrelated genotypes were studied and the conclusion was the heritability was only 12 to 18 percent overall this article found the common percent of heredity was about 20 to 50 percent causes and achievement methods theories on how to achieve happiness include encountering unexpected positive events seeing a significant other and basking in the acceptance and praise of others some others believe that happiness is not solely derived from external momentary pleasures research on positive psychology well being eudaimonia and happiness and the theories of diener ryff keyes and seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics including the biological personal relational institutional cultural and global dimensions of life the psychiatrist george vaillant and the director of longitudinal study of adult development at harvard university robert j waldinger found that those who were happiest and healthier reported strong interpersonal relationships research showed that adequate sleep contributes to well being good mental health and good relationships contribute more to happiness than income does in 2018 laurie r santos course titled psychology and the good life became the most popular course in the history of yale university and was made available for free online to non yale students some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way kahneman has said that when you look at what people want for themselves how they pursue their goals they seem more driven by the search for satisfaction than the search for happiness viktor frankl a psychiatrist and prisoner in the nazi concentration camps during world war ii noticed that those who lost hope soon died while those who held to meaning and purpose tended to live on frankl observed that joy and misery had more to do with a person s perspective and choice than with their surroundings three key sources of meaning that he highlights in his writings include the following creation of an important work or doing a deed love as manifest in thoroughly encountering another person or experience finding meaning in unavoidable suffering such as seeing it as a sacrifice or learning opportunity psychologist robert emmons has identified the centrality of goals in pursuing happiness he found that when humans pursue meaningful projects and activities without primarily focusing on happiness happiness often results as a by product indicators of meaningfulness predict positive effects on life while lack of meaning predicts negative states such as psychological distress emmons summarizes the four categories of meaning which have appeared throughout various studies he proposes to call them wist or work intimacy spirituality and transcendence throughout life one s views of happiness and what brings happiness can evolve in early and emerging adulthood many people focus on seeking happiness through friends objects and money middle aged adults generally transition from searching for object based happiness to looking for happiness in money and relationships in older adulthood people tend to focus more on personal peace and lasting relationships ex children spouse grandchildren antti kauppinen a swedish philosopher and phenomenological researcher posited that the perception of time affects the change in focus throughout life in early adulthood most view life optimistically looking to the future and seeing an entire life ahead of them those that fall into the middle life see that life has passed behind them as well as seeing more life ahead those in older adulthood often see their lives as behind them this shift in perspective causes a shift in the pursuit of happiness from more tactile object based happiness to social and relational based happiness self fulfilment theories maslow s hierarchy of needs is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs psychological and physical when a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid self actualization is reached beyond the routine of needs fulfillment maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience known as peak experiences profound moments of love understanding happiness or rapture during which a person feels more whole alive self sufficient and yet a part of the world this is similar to the flow concept of mih\u00e1ly cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi the concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time our intense focus causes us to forget any other issues which in return promotes positive emotions erich fromm said happiness is the indication that man has found the answer to the problem of human existence the productive realization of his potentialities and thus simultaneously being one with the world and preserving the integrity of his self in spending his energy productively he increases his powers he burns without being consumed self determination theory relates intrinsic motivation to three needs competence autonomy and relatedness competence refers to an individual s ability to be effective in their interactions with the environment autonomy refers to a person s flexibility in choice and decision making and relatedness is the need to establish warm close personal relationships ronald inglehart has traced cross national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the world values survey he finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness when basic needs are satisfied the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained sigmund freud said that all humans strive after happiness but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the state of things the idea of motivational hedonism is the theory that pleasure is the aim for human life positive psychology since 2000 the field of positive psychology which focuses on the study of happiness and human flourishing rather than maladjusted behavior or illness expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications it has produced many different views on causes of happiness and on factors that correlate with happiness such as positive social interactions with family and friends these factors include six key virtues 1 wisdom and knowledge which includes creativity curiosity love of learning and open mindedness 2 courage which includes bravery persistence integrity and vitality 3 humanity which includes love kindness and social intelligence 4 justice which includes leadership fairness and loyalty 5 temperance which includes self regulation prudence forgiveness humility patience and modesty 6 transcendence which includes religious spirituality hope gratitude appreciation of beauty and excellence and humor in order for a virtue to be considered a key strength in the field of positive psychology it must meet the demands of 12 criteria namely ubiquity cross cultural fulfilling morally valued does not diminish others be a nonfelicitous opposite have a clear antonym that is negative traitlike measurable distinct have paragons distinctly show up in individuals behaviors have prodigies show up in youth be selectively absent distinctly does not show up in some individuals and is supported by some institutions numerous short term self help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness yale researcher emma sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 has emphasized the importance of compassion for others balanced with self compassion compassion for others may involve service and volunteering or simply reaching out to connect show gratitude or draw others together spillover a person s level of subjective well being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one results from the famous framingham heart study indicate that friends three degrees of separation away that is friends of friends of friends can affect a person s happiness from abstract a friend who lives within a mile about 1 6 km and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25 indirect approaches various writers including camus and tolle have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy john stuart mill believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant rather than striving for it directly this meant no self consciousness scrutiny self interrogation dwelling on thinking about imagining or questioning on one s happiness then if otherwise fortunately circumstanced one would inhale happiness with the air you breathe william inge said that on the whole the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except the fact that they are so orison swett marden said that some people are born happy cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive behavioral therapy is a popular therapeutic method used to change habits by changing thoughts and problematic behaviors it focuses on emotional regulation and uses a lot of positive psychology practices it is often used for people with depression anxiety or addictions and works towards how to lead a happier life common processes in cognitive behavioral therapy are reframing thoughts from problematic thinking patterns by replacing them with beneficial or supportive ones roleplaying finding beneficial coping skills and choosing new activities that support desired behaviors and avoid negative behaviors synthetic happiness coined by harvard professor of psychology and author of stumbling on happiness daniel gilbert synthetic happiness is the happiness we make for ourselves in his tedtalk titled the surprising science of happiness gilbert explains that everyone possesses a psychological immune system that helps to regulate our emotional reactions through research that he studied and held he and his team found that personal happiness is largely based on personal perception synthetic happiness as an idea has become more popular as people attempt to define happiness as a journey instead of a destination effects happiness research understands happiness as life satisfaction or well being since it has proved difficult to find a definition of happiness individual people are instead asked how happy they feel numerous surveys are then summarized and analyzed using static methods although some researchers believe that the scales are fundamentally unsuitable for estimating happiness other researchers argue that the happiness indices formed on the basis of the survey have a high statistical correspondence with characteristics that are generally understood to indicate a happy person for example individuals who report high happiness on scales smile more often exhibit more social behavior are more helpful and are less likely to commit suicide for this reason happiness indices determined on the basis of the survey are considered reliable by happiness researchers before recommending strategies it is crucial to rely on rigorous large scale experiments that confirm their effectiveness over the past decade there has been a significant shift in what constitutes high quality evidence in psychology there were adopted e g practices like pre registration committing to specific methodological and analytical decisions in advance and increased sample sizes to avoid underpowered studies a meta analysis of 2023 has used this modern evidence based approach evaluating evidence for common happiness boosting strategies the study aimed to shed light on the effectiveness of these strategies and their impact on subjective well being as a first step the authors analyzed numerous media articles on happiness to identify the five most commonly recommended strategies these were expressing gratitude enhancing sociability exercising practicing mindfulness meditation and increasing exposure to nature next the published scientific literature was searched but limited to the above described high quality criteria that tested the effects of these strategies on subjective well being in everyday individuals non clinical samples only 10 of the initially retrieved studies met those rigorous criteria the findings revealed that unlike so far suggested by scientific studies there is currently still a lack of robust scientific evidence to support some of the most frequently suggested happiness strategies among the five most common happiness strategies there was reasonably solid evidence of positive effects from a gratitude messages or lists b conversations with strangers or gratitude and sociability that is establishing and maintaining social relationships in contrast no convincing evidence could be found that c sports d mindfulness training or e walks in the countryside make people happier positive there is a wealth of cross sectional studies on happiness and physical health that shows consistent positive relationships follow up studies appear to show that happiness does not predict longevity in sick populations but that it does predict longevity among healthy populations other positive effects of happiness and being in a good mood that have been studied and confirmed are that happier people tend to be more helpful attentive and generous to others as well as to themselves happy people also have been shown to act more cooperatively and less aggressively and be more likely to help others in need they were also found to be more sociable and communicative more positive effects that happiness seems to evoke are creative problem solving persisting through challenges more intrinsic motivation for work related or responsible tasks and being more effective at using efficient decision making strategies while some believe that success breeds happiness lyubomirsky king and diener found that happiness precedes success in income relationships marriages work performance and health low mood is correlated with many negative life outcomes such as suicide poor health substance abuse and low life expectancy by extension happiness protects from those negative outcomes negative june gruber argued that happiness may trigger a person to be more sensitive more gullible less successful and more likely to undertake high risk behaviours she also conducted studies suggesting that seeking happiness can have negative effects such as failure to meet over high expectations iris mauss has shown that the more people strive for happiness the more likely they will set up too high of standards and feel disappointed one study shows that women who value happiness more tend to react less positively to happy emotions a 2012 study found that psychological well being was higher for people who experienced both positive and negative emotions society and culture government jeremy bentham believed that public policy should attempt to maximize happiness and he even attempted to estimate a hedonic calculus thomas jefferson put the pursuit of happiness on the same level as life and liberty in the united states declaration of independence presently many countries and organizations regularly measure population happiness through large scale surveys e g bhutan richer nations tend to have higher measures of happiness than poorer nations the relationship between wealth and happiness is not linear and the same gdp increase in poor countries will have more effect on happiness than in wealthy countries some political scientists argue that life satisfaction is positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net pro worker labor market regulations and strong labor unions others argue that happiness is strongly correlated with economic freedom preferably within the context of a western mixed economy with free press and a democracy cultural values personal happiness can be affected by cultural factors hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures forcing people to marry and stay married can have adverse consequences research has shown that unhappily married couples suffer 3 25 times the risk of developing clinical depression one theory is that higher swb in richer countries is related to their more individualistic cultures individualistic cultures may satisfy intrinsic motivations to a higher degree than collectivistic cultures and fulfilling intrinsic motivations as opposed to extrinsic motivations may relate to greater levels of happiness leading to more happiness in individualistic cultures cultural views on happiness have changed over time for instance western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century not all cultures seek to maximize happiness and some cultures are averse to happiness it has been found in western cultures that individual happiness is the most important some other cultures have opposite views and tend to be aversive to the idea of individual happiness for example people living in eastern asian cultures focus more on the need for happiness within relationships with others and even find personal happiness to be harmful to fulfilling happy social relationships religion people in countries with high cultural religiosity tend to relate their life satisfaction less to their emotional experiences than people in more secular countries buddhism happiness forms a central theme of buddhist teachings for ultimate freedom from suffering the noble eightfold path leads its practitioner to nirvana a state of everlasting peace ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms more mundane forms of happiness such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people see sukha buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings hinduism in advaita vedanta the ultimate goal of life is happiness in the sense that duality between atman and brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the self in all patanjali author of the yoga sutras wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss confucianism the chinese confucian thinker mencius who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during china s warring states period was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the lesser self the physiological self and the greater self the moral self and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage hood he argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one s vital force with righteous deeds then that force would shrivel up mencius 6a 15 2a 2 more specifically he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues especially through music judaism happiness or simcha hebrew \u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05d4 in judaism is considered an important element in the service of god the biblical verse worship the lord with gladness come before him with joyful songs psalm 100 2 stresses joy in the service of god a popular teaching by rabbi nachman of breslov a 19th century chassidic rabbi is mitzvah gedolah le hiyot besimcha tamid it is a great mitzvah commandment to always be in a state of happiness when a person is happy they are much more capable of serving god and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset christianity the primary meaning of happiness in various european languages involves good fortune blessing or a similar happening the meaning in greek philosophy refers primarily to ethics in christianity the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity latin equivalent to the greek eudaimonia blessed happiness described by the 13th century philosopher theologian thomas aquinas as a beatific vision of god s essence in the next life according to augustine of hippo and thomas aquinas man s last end is happiness all men agree in desiring the last end which is happiness aquinas agreed with aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts such as habits according to virtue according to aquinas happiness consists in an operation of the speculative intellect consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation viz in the contemplation of divine things and the last end cannot consist in the active life which pertains to the practical intellect so therefore the last and perfect happiness which we await in the life to come consists entirely in contemplation but imperfect happiness such as can be had here consists first and principally in contemplation but secondarily in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions human complexities like reason and cognition can produce well being or happiness but such form is limited and transitory in temporal life the contemplation of god the infinitely beautiful is the supreme delight of the will beatitudo or perfect happiness as complete well being is to be attained not in this life but the next islam al ghazali 1058 1111 the sufi thinker wrote that the alchemy of happiness is a manual of religious instruction that is used throughout the muslim world and widely practiced today philosophy relation to morality philosophy of happiness is often discussed in conjunction with ethics traditional european societies inherited from the greeks and from christianity often linked happiness with morality in this context morality was the performance in a specific role in a certain kind of social life happiness remains a difficult term for moral philosophy throughout the history of moral philosophy there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness or defining it as nothing to do with happiness at all in psychology connections between happiness and morality have been studied in a variety of ways empirical research suggests that laypeople s judgments of a person s happiness in part depend on perceptions of that person s morality suggesting that judgments of others happiness involve moral evaluation a large body of research also suggests that engaging in prosocial behavior can increase happiness ethics ethicists have made arguments for how humans should behave either individually or collectively based on the resulting happiness of such behavior utilitarians such as john stuart mill and jeremy bentham advocated the greatest happiness principle as a guide for ethical behavior this principle states that actions are proportionately right or wrong by how much happiness or unhappiness they bring mill defines happiness as that which brings about an intended pleasure and avoids an unnecessary pain and he defines unhappiness as the reverse namely an action that brings about pain and not pleasure he is quick to specify that pleasure and pain are to be understood in an epicurean light referring chiefly to the higher human pleasures of increased intellect feelings and moral sentiments not what one might call beastly pleasures of mere animal appetites critics of this view include thomas carlyle ferdinand t\u00f6nnies and others within the german philosophical tradition they posit that a greater happiness is to be found in choosing to suffer for others rather than allowing others to suffer for them declaring this to be a form of satisfying and heroic nobility many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and well being in a study of older adults those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live and less depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over 30 years and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one a study on adults aged 55 and older found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality aristotle aristotle described eudaimonia greek \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 as the goal of human thought and action eudaimonia is often translated to mean happiness but some scholars contend that human flourishing may be a more accurate translation aristotle s use of the term in nicomachiean ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness in the nicomachean ethics written in 350 bce aristotle stated that happiness also being well and doing well is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake unlike riches honour health or friendship he observed that men sought riches or honour or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy for aristotle the term eudaimonia which is translated as happiness or flourishing is an activity rather than an emotion or a state eudaimonia greek \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 is a classical greek word consists of the word eu good or well being and daim\u014dn spirit or minor deity used by extension to mean one s lot or fortune thus understood the happy life is the good life that is a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way specifically aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity he arrived at this claim with the function argument basically if it is right every living thing has a function that which it uniquely does for aristotle human function is to reason since it is that alone which humans uniquely do and performing one s function well or excellently is good according to aristotle the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life aristotle argued a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue the key question aristotle seeks to answer is what is the ultimate purpose of human existence a lot of people are seeking pleasure health and a good reputation it is true that those have a value but none of them can occupy the place of the greatest good for which humanity aims it may seem like all goods are a means to obtain happiness but aristotle said that happiness is always an end in itself nietzsche friedrich nietzsche critiqued the english utilitarians focus on attaining the greatest happiness stating that man does not strive for happiness only the englishman does nietzsche meant that making happiness one s ultimate goal and the aim of one s existence in his words makes one contemptible nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher more difficult goals than mere happiness he introduced the quasi dystopic figure of the last man as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness seekers these small last men who seek after only their own pleasure and health avoiding all danger exertion difficulty challenge struggle are meant to seem contemptible to nietzsche s reader nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult what can only be earned through struggle difficulty pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life including all the highest achievements of human culture not least of all philosophy see also smiling notes references sources seligman martin e p csikszentmihalyi mihaly 2000 positive psychology an introduction american psychologist 55 1 5 14 citeseerx 10 1 1 183 6660

associated with or characterized by feelings of disadvantage loss despair grief helplessness disappointment and sorrow an individual experiencing sadness may become quiet or lethargic and withdraw themselves from others an example of severe sadness is depression a mood which can be brought on by major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder crying can be an indication of sadness sadness is one of the six basic emotions described by paul ekman along with happiness anger surprise fear and disgust 271 4 childhood sadness is a common experience in childhood sometimes sadness can lead to depression some families may have a conscious or unconscious rule that sadness is not allowed but robin skynner has suggested that this may cause problems arguing that with sadness screened off people can become shallow and manic 33 36 pediatrician t berry brazelton suggests that acknowledging sadness can make it easier for families to address more serious emotional problems 46 48 sadness is part of the normal process of the child separating from an early symbiosis with the mother and becoming more independent every time a child separates a little more he or she will have to cope with a small loss if the mother cannot allow the minor distress involved the child may never learn how to deal with sadness by themselves 158 9 brazelton argues that too much cheering a child up devalues the emotion of sadness for them 52 and selma fraiberg suggests that it is important to respect a child s right to experience a loss fully and deeply margaret mahler also saw the ability to feel sadness as an emotional achievement as opposed for example to warding it off through restless hyperactivity d w winnicott similarly saw in sad crying the psychological root of valuable musical experiences in later life neuroanatomy a large amount of research has been conducted on the neuroscience of sadness according to the american journal of psychiatry sadness has been found to be associated with increases in bilateral activity within the vicinity of the middle and posterior temporal cortex lateral cerebellum cerebellar vermis midbrain putamen and caudate using positron emission tomography pet researchers were able to provoke sadness among seven normal men and women by asking them to think about sad things they observed increased brain activity in the bilateral inferior and orbitofrontal cortex in a study that induced sadness in subjects by showing emotional film clips the feeling was correlated with significant increases in regional brain activity especially in the prefrontal cortex in the region called brodmann s area 9 and the thalamus a significant increase in activity was also observed in the bilateral anterior temporal structures function according to functional theories emotions are designed to allow people to effectively deal with the situations that evoke the emotion sadness is believed to serve two primary functions that enhance one s ability to cope with loss one function is the promotion of cognitive changes that restructure beliefs and goals and reevaluate implications for instance when sad people tend to be less affected by their schemas in general including schemas regarding political ideology the heuristic regarding how a conservative or a liberal should respond when making political decisions another function is to signal a need for assistance and elicit support from others this may be done by following the group norms being kinder to others and expressing the need for help physically and verbally as a result the experience of sadness as a group may decrease emotional polarization and increase relationship building coping mechanisms people deal with sadness in different ways and it is an important emotion because it helps to motivate people to deal with their situation some coping mechanisms include getting social support and or spending time with a pet creating a list or engaging in some activity to express sadness some individuals when feeling sad may exclude themselves from a social setting so as to take the time to recover from the feeling while being one of the moods people most want to shake sadness can sometimes be perpetuated by the very coping strategies chosen such as ruminating drowning one s sorrows or permanently isolating oneself 69 70 as alternative ways of coping with sadness to the above cognitive behavioral therapy suggests instead either challenging one s negative thoughts or scheduling some positive event as a distraction 72 being attentive to and patient with one s sadness may also be a way for people to learn through solitude while emotional support to help people stay with their sadness can be further helpful 164 such an approach is fueled by the underlying belief that loss when felt wholeheartedly can lead to a new sense of aliveness and to a re engagement with the outside world pupil empathy pupil size may be an indicator of sadness a sad facial expression with small pupils is judged to be more intensely sad as the pupil size decreases a person s own pupil size also mirrors this and becomes smaller when viewing sad faces with small pupils no parallel effect exists when people look at neutral happy or angry expressions the greater degree to which a person s pupils mirror another predicts a person s greater score on empathy in disorders such as autism and psychopathy facial expressions that represent sadness may be subtle which may show a need for a more non linguistic situation to affect their level of empathy vocal expression according to dipr scientist swati johar vii sadness is an emotion identified by current speech dialogue and processing systems 12 measurements to distinguish sadness from other emotions in the human voice include root mean square rms energy inter word silence and speaking rate it is communicated mostly by lowering the mean and variability of the fundamental frequency f0 besides being associated with lower vocal intensity and with decreases in f0 over time johar argues that when someone is sad slow low pitched speech with weak high audio frequency energy is produced likewise low energy state of sadness attributes to slow tempo lower speech rate and mean pitch 10 13 sadness is as stated by klaus scherer one of the best recognized emotions in the human voice although it s generally somewhat lower than that of facial expression in a study by scherer it was found that in western countries sadness had 79 of accuracy for facial recognition and 71 for vocal while in non western countries the results were of 74 and 58 respectively cultural explorations during the renaissance edmund spenser in the faerie queene endorsed sadness as a marker of spiritual commitment in the lord of the rings sadness is distinguished from unhappiness to exemplify j r r tolkien s preference for a sad but settled determination as opposed to what he saw as the shallower temptations of either despair or hope julia kristeva considered that a diversification of moods variety in sadness refinement in sorrow or mourning are the imprint of a humanity that is surely not triumphant but subtle ready to fight and creative see also joie de vivre melancholia mood psychology references further reading", "Anger": "anger also known as wrath uk roth us rath or rage is an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and non cooperative response to a perceived provocation hurt or threat a person experiencing anger will often experience physical effects such as increased heart rate elevated blood pressure and increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline some view anger as an emotion that triggers part of the fight or flight response anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally cognitively and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force anger can have many physical and mental consequences the external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions body language physiological responses and at times public acts of aggression facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown while most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of what has happened to them psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self monitoring capacity and objective observability modern psychologists view anger as a normal natural and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times and as something that has functional value for survival uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well being and negatively impact those around them while many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger the issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers but modern psychologists in contrast to earlier writers have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger psychology and sociology three types of anger are recognized by psychologists hasty and sudden anger is connected to the impulse for self preservation it is shared by humans and other animals and it occurs when the animal feels tormented or trapped this form of anger is episodic settled and deliberate anger is a reaction to perceived deliberate harm or unfair treatment by others this form of anger is episodic dispositional anger is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions irritability sullenness and churlishness are examples of the last form of anger anger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors promotion of social justice communication of negative sentiment and redress of grievances it can also facilitate patience in contrast anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression anger in its strong form impairs one s ability to process information and to exert cognitive control over one s behavior an angry person may lose their objectivity empathy prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to themselves or others there is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression verbal or physical direct or indirect even though they mutually influence each other while anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression neuropsychological perspective extension of the stimuli of the fighting reactions at the beginning of life the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines their movements there is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli as distinct from other stimulation in anger at a later date the child learns that certain actions such as striking scolding and screaming are effective toward persons but not toward things in adults though the infantile response is still sometimes seen the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence brain regions which are activated when recognizing threat or provocation and facilitate autonomic arousal and interoception and activate the stress response are the salience network dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula cortex and subcortical area the thalamus the amygdala and the brain stem differences between related concepts raymond novaco of university of california irvine who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject stratified anger into three modalities cognitive appraisals somatic affective tension and agitations and behavioral withdrawal and antagonism the words annoyance and rage are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury at the high end rage problems are conceptualized as the inability to process emotions or life s experiences either because the capacity to regulate emotion schore 1994 has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma rage is understood as raw undifferentiated emotions that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed no matter how trivial puts more stress on the organism than it can bear anger when viewed as a protective response or instinct to a perceived threat is considered as positive the negative expression of this state is known as aggression commits antisocial personality disorder and intermittent explosive disorder acting on this misplaced state is rage due to possible potential errors in perception and judgment examples characteristics william defoore an anger management writer described anger as a pressure cooker stating that we can only suppress or apply pressure against our happy for so long before it erupts one simple trichotomy of anger expression is passive anger versus aggressive anger versus assertive anger these three types of anger have some characteristic symptoms passive anger passive anger can be expressed in the following ways dispassion such as giving someone the cold shoulder or a fake smile looking unconcerned or sitting on the fence while others sort things out dampening feelings with substance abuse overreacting oversleeping not responding to another s anger frigidity indulging in sexual practices that depress spontaneity and make objects of participants giving inordinate amounts of time to machines objects or intellectual pursuits talking of frustrations but showing no feeling evasiveness such as turning one s back in a crisis avoiding conflict not arguing back becoming phobic defeatism such as setting people up for failure choosing unreliable people to depend on being accident prone underachieving sexual impotence expressing frustration at insignificant things but ignoring serious ones obsessive behavior such as needing to be inordinately clean and tidy making a habit of constantly checking things over dieting or overeating demanding that all jobs be done perfectly psychological manipulation such as provoking people to aggression and then patronizing them provoking aggression but staying on the sidelines emotional blackmail false tearfulness feigning illness sabotaging relationships using sexual provocation using a third party to convey negative feelings withholding money or resources secretive behavior such as stockpiling resentments that are expressed behind people s backs giving the silent treatment or under the breath mutterings avoiding eye contact putting people down gossiping anonymous complaints poison pen letters stealing and conning self blame such as apologizing too often being overly critical inviting criticism aggressive anger the symptoms of aggressive anger are bullying such as threatening people directly persecuting insulting pushing or shoving using power to

in scale assertive anger blame such as after a particular individual commits an action that s possibly frowned upon the particular person will resort to scolding this is in fact common in discipline terms punishment the angry person will give a temporary punishment to an individual like further limiting a child s will to do anything they want like playing video games watching television etc after they did something to cause trouble or disciplining a pet sternness such as calling out a person on their behaviour with their voices raised with utter disapproval disappointment six dimensions of anger expression anger expression can take on many more styles than passive or aggressive ephrem fernandez has identified six dimensions of anger expression they relate to the direction of anger its locus reaction modality impulsivity and objective coordinates on each of these dimensions can be connected to generate a profile of a person s anger expression style among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system are the familiar profile of the person with explosive anger profile of the person with repressive anger profile of the passive aggressive person and the profile of constructive anger expression ethnicity and culture much research has explored whether the emotion of anger is experienced and expressed differently depending on the culture matsumoto 2007 conducted a study in which white american and asian participants needed to express the emotions from a program called jacfee japanese and caucasian facial expression of emotion in order to determine whether caucasian observers noticed any differences in expression of participants of a different nationality he found that participants were unable to assign a nationality to people demonstrating expression of anger i e they could not distinguish ethnic specific expressions of anger hatfield rapson and le 2009 conducted a study that measured ethnic differences in emotional expression using participants from the philippines hawaii china and europe they concluded that there was a difference between how someone expresses an emotion especially the emotion of anger in people with different ethnicities based on frequency with europeans showing the lowest frequency of expression of negative emotions other research investigates anger within different ethnic groups who live in the same country researchers explored whether black americans experience and express greater anger than whites mabry kiecolt 2005 they found that after controlling for sex and age black participants did not feel or express more anger than whites deffenbacher and swaim 1999 compared the expression of anger in mexican american people and white non hispanic american people they concluded that white non hispanic americans expressed more verbal aggression than mexican americans although when it came to physical aggression expressions there was no significant difference between both cultures when it came to anger causes some animals make loud sounds attempt to look physically larger bare their teeth and stare the behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy for social influence people feel really angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event when they are convinced someone else is responsible and when they feel they can still influence the situation or cope with it for instance if a person s car is damaged they will feel angry if someone else did it e g another driver rear ended it but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces e g a hailstorm or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible e g they crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness psychotherapist michael c graham defines anger in terms of our expectations and assumptions about the world graham states anger almost always results when we are caught up expecting the world to be different than it is usually those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of what has happened to them and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause the angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional personal and controllable aspect of another person s behavior this explanation is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self monitoring capacity and objective observability as a result of their emotion anger can be of multicausal origin some of which may be remote events but people rarely find more than one cause for their anger according to novaco anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental temporal context disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations of anger according to encyclop\u00e6dia britannica an internal infection can cause pain which in turn can activate anger according to cognitive consistency theory anger is caused by an inconsistency between a desired or expected situation and the actually perceived situation and triggers responses such as aggressive behavior with the expected consequence of reducing the inconsistency sleep deprivation also seems to be a cause of anger cognitive effects anger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli dangers seem smaller actions seem less risky ventures seem more likely to succeed and unfortunate events seem less likely angry people are more likely to make risky decisions and make less realistic risk assessments in one study test subjects primed to feel angry felt less likely to have heart disease and more likely to receive a pay raise compared to fearful people this tendency can manifest in retrospective thinking as well in a 2005 study angry subjects said they thought the risks of terrorism in the year following 9 11 in retrospect were low compared to what the fearful and neutral subjects thought in inter group relationships anger makes people think in more negative and prejudiced terms about outsiders anger makes people less trusting and slower to attribute good qualities to outsiders when a group is in conflict with a rival group it will feel more anger if it is the politically stronger group and less anger when it is the weaker unlike other negative emotions like sadness and fear angry people are more likely to demonstrate correspondence bias the tendency to blame a person s behavior more on his nature than on his circumstances they tend to rely more on stereotypes and pay less attention to details and more attention to the superficial in this regard anger is unlike other negative emotions such as sadness and fear which promote analytical thinking an angry person tends to anticipate other events that might cause them anger they will tend to rate anger causing events e g being sold a faulty car as more likely than sad events e g a good friend moving away a person who is angry tends to place more blame on another person for their misery this can create a feedback as this extra blame can make the angry person angrier still so they in turn place yet more blame on the other person when people are in a certain emotional state they tend to pay more attention to or remember things that are charged with the same emotion so it is with anger for instance if a person is trying to persuade someone that a tax increase is necessary if the person is currently feeling angry they would do better to use an argument that elicits anger more criminals will escape justice than say an argument that elicits sadness there will be fewer welfare benefits for disabled children also unlike other negative emotions which focus attention on all negative events anger only focuses attention on anger causing events anger can make a person more desiring of an object to which his anger is tied in a 2010 dutch study test subjects were primed to feel anger or fear by being shown an image of an angry or fearful face and then were shown an image of a random object when subjects were made to feel angry they expressed more desire to possess that object than subjects who had been primed to feel fear expressive strategies as with any emotion the display of anger can be feigned or exaggerated studies by hochschild and sutton have shown that the show of anger is likely to be an effective manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes anger is a distinct strategy of social influence and its use e g belligerent behaviors as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy larissa tiedens known for her studies of anger claimed that expression of feelings would cause a powerful influence not only on the perception of the expresser but also on their power position in the society she studied the correlation between anger expression and social influence perception previous researchers such as keating 1985 have found that people with angry face expression were perceived as powerful and as in a high social position similarly tiedens et al have revealed that people who compared scenarios involving an angry and a sad character attributed a higher social status to the angry character tiedens examined in her study whether anger expression promotes status attribution in other words whether anger contributes to perceptions or legitimization of others behaviors her findings clearly indicated that participants who were exposed to either an angry or a sad person were inclined to express support for the angry person rather than for a sad one in addition it was found that a reason for that decision originates from the fact that the person expressing anger was perceived as an ability owner and was attributed a certain social status accordingly showing anger during a negotiation may increase the ability of the anger expresser to succeed in negotiation a study by tiedens et al indicated that the anger expressers were perceived as stubborn dominant and powerful in addition it was found that people were inclined to easily give up to those who were perceived by them as powerful and stubborn rather than soft and submissive based on these findings sinaceur and tiedens have found that people conceded more to the angry side rather than for the non angry one a question raised by van kleef et al based on these findings was whether expression of emotion influences others since it is known that people use emotional information to conclude about others limits and match their demands in negotiation accordingly van kleef et al wanted to explore whether people give up more easily to an angry opponent or to a happy opponent findings revealed that participants tended to be more flexible toward an angry opponent compared with a happy opponent these results strengthen the argument that participants analyze the opponent s emotion to conclude about their limits and carry out their decisions accordingly coping strategies therapy and behavioral strategies according to leland r beaumont each instance of anger demands making a choice a person can respond with hostile action including overt violence or they can respond with hostile inaction such as withdrawing or stonewalling other options include initiating a dominance contest harboring resentment or working to better understand and constructively resolve the issue according to raymond novaco there are a multitude of steps that were researched in attempting to deal with this emotion in order to manage anger the problems involved in the anger should be discussed novaco suggests the situations leading to anger should be explored by the person conventional therapies for anger involve restructuring thoughts and beliefs to bring about a reduction in anger these therapies often come within the schools of cbt or cognitive behavioral therapy like modern systems such as rebt rational emotive behavior therapy research shows that people with excessive anger often harbor and act on dysfunctional attributions assumptions and evaluations in specific situations it has been shown that with therapy by a trained professional individuals can bring their anger to more manageable levels the therapy is followed by the so called stress inoculation in which the clients are taught relaxation skills to control their arousal and various cognitive controls to exercise on their attention thoughts images and feelings logic defeats anger because anger even when it s justified can quickly become irrational american psychological association in other words although there may be a rational reason to get angry the frustrated actions of the subject can become irrational taking deep breaths is regarded as the first step to calming down once the anger has subsided a little the patient will accept that they are frustrated and move on lingering around the source of frustration may bring the rage back the skills deficit model states that poor social skills is what renders a person incapable of expressing anger in an appropriate manner social skills training has been found to be an effective method for reducing exaggerated anger by offering alternative coping skills to the angry individual research has found that persons who are prepared for aversive events find them less threatening and excitatory reactions are significantly reduced in a 1981 study that used modeling behavior rehearsal and videotaped feedback to increase anger control skills showed increases in anger control among aggressive youth in the study research conducted with youthful offenders using a social skills training program aggression replacement training found significant reductions in anger and increases in anger control research has also found that antisocial personalities are more likely to learn avoidance tasks when the consequences involved obtaining or losing tangible rewards learning among antisocial personalities also occurred better when they were involved with high intensity stimulation social learning theory states that positive stimulation was not compatible with hostile or aggressive reactions anger research has also studied the effects of reducing anger among adults with antisocial personality disorder aspd with a social skills program approach that used a low fear and high arousal group setting this research found that low fear messages were less provocative to the aspd population and high positive arousal stimulated their ability to concentrate and subsequently learn new skills for anger reduction a new integrative approach to anger treatment has been formulated by fernandez 2010 termed cbat for cognitive behavioral affective therapy this treatment goes beyond conventional relaxation and reappraisal by adding cognitive and behavioral techniques and supplementing them with effective techniques to deal with the feeling of anger the techniques are sequenced contingently in three phases of treatment prevention intervention and postvention in this way people can be trained to deal with the onset of anger its progression and the residual features of anger medication therapy systematic reviews and meta analyses suggest that certain psychiatric medications may be effective in controlling symptoms of anger hostility and irritability these include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri antidepressants like sertraline certain anticonvulsant mood stabilizers antipsychotics like aripiprazole risperidone and olanzapine and benzodiazepines like midazolam among others another meta analysis of antidepressants and aggression found no change in aggression in adults and increased aggression in children psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamines as well as the atypical antipsychotic risperidone are useful in reducing aggression and oppositionality in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd antisocial personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder with moderate to large effect sizes and greater effectiveness than other studied medications yet another meta analysis found that methylphenidate slightly reduced irritability while amphetamines increased the risk of irritability several fold in children with adhd other research has found no impact of amphetamine or methamphetamine on aggression in humans suppression modern psychologists point out that suppression of anger may have harmful effects the suppressed anger may find another outlet such as a physical symptom or become more extreme john w fiero cites los angeles riots of 1992 as an example of sudden explosive release of suppressed anger the anger was then displaced as violence against those who had nothing to do with the matter there is also the case of francine hughes who suffered 13 years of domestic abuse her suppressed anger drove her to kill her abuser husband it is claimed that a majority of female victims of domestic violence who suppress their aggressive feelings are unable to recognize experience and process negative emotion and this has a destabilising influence on their perception of agency in their relationships another example of widespread deflection of anger from its actual cause toward scapegoating fiero says was the blaming of jews for the economic ills of germany by the nazis some psychologists criticized the catharsis theory of aggression which suggests that releasing pent up anger reduces aggression on the other hand there are experts who maintain that suppression does not eliminate anger since it merely forbids the expression of anger and this is also the case for repression which merely hides anger from awareness there are also studies that link suppressed anger and medical conditions such as hypertension coronary artery disease and cancer suppressed or repressed anger is found to cause irritable bowel syndrome eating disorders and depression among women suppression is also referred to as a form of self silencing which is described as a cognitive activity wherein an individual monitors the self and eliminate thoughts and feelings that are perceived to be dangerous to relationships anger suppression is also associated with higher rates of suicide dual threshold model anger expression might have negative outcomes for individuals and organizations as well such as decrease of productivity and increase of job stress it could also have positive outcomes such as increased work motivation improved relationships and increased mutual understanding for ex tiedens 2000 a dual threshold model of anger in organizations by geddes and callister 2007 provides an explanation on the valence of anger expression outcomes the model suggests that organizational norms establish emotion thresholds that may be crossed when employees feel anger the first expression threshold is crossed when an organizational member conveys felt anger to individuals at work who are associated with or able to address the anger provoking situation the second impropriety threshold is crossed if or when organizational members go too far while expressing anger such that observers and other company personnel find their actions socially and or culturally inappropriate the higher probability of negative outcomes from workplace anger likely will occur in either of two situations the first is when organizational members suppress rather than express their anger that is they fail to cross the expression threshold in this instance personnel who might be able to address or resolve the anger provoking condition or event remain unaware of the problem allowing it to continue along with the affected individual s anger the second is when organizational members cross both thresholds double cross displaying anger that is perceived as deviant in such cases the angry person is seen as the problem increasing chances of organizational sanctions against him or her while diverting attention away from the initial anger provoking incident in contrast a higher probability of positive outcomes from workplace anger expression likely will occur when one s expressed anger stays in the space between the expression and impropriety thresholds here one expresses anger in a way fellow organizational members find acceptable prompting exchanges and discussions that may help resolve concerns to the satisfaction of all parties involved this space between the thresholds varies among different organizations and also can be changed in organization itself when the change is directed to support anger displays the space between the thresholds will be expanded and when the change is directed to suppressing such displays the space will be reduced physiology neuroscience has shown that emotions are generated by multiple structures in the brain the rapid minimal and evaluative processing of the emotional significance of the sensory data is done when the data passes through the amygdala in its travel from the sensory organs along certain neural pathways towards the limbic forebrain emotion caused by discrimination of stimulus features thoughts or memories occurs when its information is relayed from the thalamus to the neocortex based on some statistical analysis some scholars have suggested that the tendency for anger may be genetic distinguishing between genetic and environmental factors requires further research and actual measurement of specific genes and environments in neuroimaging studies of anger the most consistently activated region of the brain was the lateral orbitofrontal cortex this region is associated with approach motivation and positive affective processes the external expression of anger can be found in physiological responses facial expressions body language and at times in public acts of aggression the rib cage tenses and breathing through the nose becomes faster deeper and irregular anger activates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis the catecholamine activation is more strongly norepinephrine than epinephrine heart rate and blood pressure increase blood flows to the hands perspiration increases particularly when the anger is intense the face flushes the nostrils flare the jaw tenses the brow muscles move inward and downward fixing a hard stare on the target the arms are raised and a squared off stance is adopted the body is mobilized for immediate action often manifesting as a subjective sense of strength self assurance and potency this may encourage the impulse to strike out measuring anger the gallup world poll every year gallup asks people in over 140 countries did you experience anger during a lot of the day yesterday in 2021 gallup found that 23 of adults experienced a lot of anger which is up from 18 in 2014 the countries that experienced the most anger were lebanon turkey armenia iraq and afghanistan the countries that experience the least anger were finland mauritius estonia portugal and the netherlands self reports of psychological anger the most common way to measure anger has been through the use of self report measures it is currently thought there are just under 50 measures of psychological anger the spielberger state trait anger expression inventory and the novaco anger scale and provocation inventory are widely recognized and frequently used self report measures for assessing anger focusing on various aspects of anger expression including outward inward and controlled expressions additionally various anger scales draw on different perspectives such as cognitive processes of anger rumination anger as behavioral and cognitive responses to avoidance assertion and social support cognitive and emotional aspects of irritability functional and dysfunctional responses and goal oriented behavior in response to anger experiences of anger and positive beliefs about anger some approaches even consider anger as being reciprocally related to frustration and hostility in 2023 a study revealed that the relationships between 46 subscales of publicly available self report measures of anger suggest five primary factors these factors suggest a model of five key dimensions to anger anger arousal anger rumination frustration discomfort anger regulation and socially constituted anger the proposed five factor model is based on various theoretical contexts and provides a useful framework for examining the distinct domains of anger anger arousal which acknowledges the commonly observed existence of anger expressions in everyday life this domain highlights the tendency for frequent and intense anger experiences and offers a means to examine how anger can represent an individual s stable and predictable responses to different situations anger rumination which centers around the cognitive and emotional processes that occur within an individual regarding anger and the cognitive appraisals and action tendencies in response to perceived wrong doings this domain offers an opportunity to examine anger within the broader context of rumination and explore how metacognitive beliefs about emotional stress like anger can lead to behavioral and emotional dysregulation such as depression frustration discomfort which reflects measures that are tailored to rational emotive behavior theory which explore absolutistic and demand related beliefs related to entitlement achievement and alleviating discomfort this domain provides an opportunity to examine how our cognitive beliefs give rise to expressions of anger anger regulation which reflects cognitive strategies or processes that modify the expression and experience of anger this domain provides a chance to examine coping strategies such as avoidance seeking distraction and downplaying which are common ways of managing stressful situations related to anger socially constituted anger which takes a socially constructed perspective on anger and views anger as operating within social dominance and conflict dynamics this approach recognizes that the recognition of anger in others can reveal their possible motivations and highlight potential disagreements between individuals values particularly in terms of within the protection and enhancement of the self social norms and the extent to which anger is constructed via joint understandings of the world the study suggests a number of existing subscales that can be used to measure these five domains of anger philosophical perspectives ancient history ancient greek philosophers describing and commenting on the uncontrolled anger particularly toward slaves in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger galen and seneca regarded anger as a kind of madness they all rejected the spontaneous uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger there were disagreements regarding the value of anger for seneca anger was worthless even for war seneca believed that the disciplined roman army was regularly able to beat the germans who were known for their fury he argued that in sporting contests it is a mistake to become angry aristotle on the other hand ascribed some value to anger that has arisen from perceived injustice because it is useful for preventing injustice furthermore the opposite of anger is a kind of insensibility aristotle stated the difference in people s temperaments was generally viewed as a result of the different mix of qualities or humors people contained seneca held that red haired and red faced people are hot tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors ancient philosophers rarely refer to women s anger at all according to simon kemp and k t strongman perhaps because their works were not intended for women some of them that discuss it such as seneca considered women to be more prone to anger than men control methods seneca addresses the question of mastering anger in three parts 1 how to avoid becoming angry in the first place 2 how to cease being angry and 3 how to deal with anger in others seneca suggests to avoid becoming angry in the first place that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered one should avoid being too busy or dealing with anger provoking people unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to to cease being angry seneca suggests one to check speech and impulses and be aware of particular sources of personal irritation in dealing with other people one should not be too inquisitive it is not always soothing to hear and see everything when someone appears to slight you you should be at first reluctant to believe this and should wait to hear the full story you should also put yourself in the place of the other person trying to understand his motives and any extenuating factors such as age or illness seneca further advises daily self inquisition about one s bad habit to deal with anger in others seneca suggests that the best reaction is to keep calm a certain kind of deception seneca says is necessary in dealing with angry people galen repeats seneca s points but adds a new one finding a guide and teacher can help the person in controlling their passions galen also gives some hints for finding a good teacher both seneca and galen and later philosophers agree that the process of controlling anger should start in childhood on grounds of malleability seneca warns that this education should not blunt the spirit of the children nor should they be humiliated or treated severely at the same time they should not be pampered children seneca says should learn not to beat their playmates and not to become angry with them seneca also advises that children s requests should not be granted when they are angry post classical history during the period of the roman empire and the middle ages philosophers elaborated on the existing conception of anger many of whom did not make major contributions to the concept for example many medieval philosophers such as ibn sina avicenna roger bacon and thomas aquinas agreed with ancient philosophers that animals cannot become angry on the other hand al ghazali algazel who often disagreed with aristotle and ibn sina on many issues argued that animals do possess anger as one of the three powers in their heart the other two being appetite and impulse he also argued that animal will is conditioned by anger and appetite in contrast to human will which is conditioned by the intellect a common medieval belief was that those prone to anger had an excess of yellow bile or choler hence the word choleric this belief was related to seneca s belief that red haired and red faced people are hot tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors by gender wrath was sinful because of the social problems it caused sometimes even homicide it served to ignore those who are present contradicts those who are absent produces insults and responds harshly to insults that are received aristotle felt that anger or wrath was a natural outburst of self defense in situations where people felt they had been wronged aquinas felt that if anger was justified it was not a sin for example he that is angry without cause shall be in danger but he that is angry with cause shall not be in danger for without anger teaching will be useless judgments unstable crimes unchecked therefore to be angry is not always an evil the concept of wrath contributed to a definition of gender and power many medieval authors in 1200 agreed the differences between men and women were based on complexion shape and disposition complexion involved the balance of the four fundamental qualities of heat coldness moistness and dryness when various combinations of these qualities are made they define groups of certain people as well as individuals hippocrates aristotle and galen all agreed on that in terms of biology and sexual differentiation heat was the most important of the qualities because it determined shape and disposition disposition included a balance of the previous four qualities the four elements and the four humors for example the element of fire shared the qualities of heat and dryness fire dominated in yellow bile or choler meaning a choleric person was more or hot and dry than others hot and dry individuals were active dominant and aggressive the opposite was true with the element of water water is cold and moist related closely to phlegm people with more phlegmatic personalities were passive and submissive while these trait clusters varied from individual to individual most authors in the middle ages assumed certain clusters of traits characterized men more than women and vice versa women scholars posted that females were seen by authors in the middle ages to be more phlegmatic cold and wet than males meaning females were more sedentary and passive than males women s passive nature appeared natural due to their lack of power when compared to men aristotle identified traits he believed women shared female feminine passive focused on matter inactive and inferior thus medieval women were supposed to act submissively toward men and relinquish control to their husbands hildegard of bingen believed women were fully capable of anger while most women were phlegmatic individual women under certain circumstances could also be choleric men medieval scholars believed most men were choleric or hot and dry thus they were dominant and aggressive barton aristotle also identified characteristics of men male masculine active focused on form potent outstanding and superior men were aware of the power they held given their choleric nature men exhibited hot temperatures and were quick to anger peter of albano once said the male s spirit is lively given to violent impulse it is slow getting angry and slower being calmed medieval ideas of gender assumed men were more rational than women masculinity involved a wide range of possible behaviors and men were not angry all the time every man s humoral balance was different some men were strong others weak also some more prone to wrath than others there are those who view anger as a manly act for instance david brakke maintained because anger motivated a man to action in righting wrongs to himself and others because its opposite appeared to be passivity in the face of challenges from other males because to put it simply it raised the body s temperature anger appeared to be a characteristic of masculinity a sign that a man was indeed a manly man control methods maimonides considered being given to uncontrollable passions as a kind of illness like galen maimonides suggested seeking out a philosopher for curing this illness just as one seeks out a physician for curing bodily illnesses roger bacon elaborates seneca s advices many medieval writers discuss at length the evils of anger and the virtues of temperance in a discussion of confession john mirk an english 14th century augustinian writer tells priests how to advise the penitent by considering the spiritual and social consequences of anger in the canon of medicine ibn sina avicenna modified the theory of temperaments and argued that anger heralded the transition of melancholia to mania and explained that humidity inside the head can contribute to such mood disorders on the other hand ahmed ibn sahl al balkhi classified anger along with aggression as a type of neurosis while al ghazali argued that anger takes form in rage indignation and revenge and that the powers of the soul become balanced if it keeps anger under control modern perspectives immanuel kant rejects revenge as vicious regarding the latter david hume argues that because anger and hatred are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution the lack of them is sometimes evidence of weakness and imbecility martha nussbaum has also agreed that even great injustice is no excuse for childish and undisciplined behavior two main differences between the modern understanding and ancient understanding of anger can be detected kemp and strongman state one is that early philosophers were not concerned with possible harmful effects of the suppression of anger the other is that recently studies of anger take the issue of gender differences into account soraya chemaly has in contrast argued that anger is a critically useful and positive emotion which warns us as humans that something is wrong and needs to change when being threatened with indignity physical harm humiliation and unfairness and therefore a powerful force for political good furthermore she argues that women and minorities are not allowed to be angry to the same extent as white men in a similar vein rebecca traister has argued that holding back anger has been an impediment to the progress of women s rights the american psychologist albert ellis has suggested that anger rage and fury partly have roots in the philosophical meanings and assumptions through which human beings interpret transgression according to ellis these emotions are often associated and related to the leaning humans have to absolutistically depreciating and damning other peoples humanity when their personal rules and domain are transgressed religious perspectives judaism in judaism anger is a negative trait in the book of genesis jacob condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons simon and levi cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable as ethics of the fathers states ben zoma said who is strong he who subdues his evil inclination as it is stated he who is slow to anger is better than a strong man and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city proverbs 16 32 maimonides rules that one who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols rabbi shneur zalman of liadi explains that the parallel between anger and idol worship is that by becoming angry one shows a disregard of divine providence whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from above and that through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of god in one s life in its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt the kitzur shulchan aruch states anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs you should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry in modern writings rabbi harold kushner finds no grounds for anger toward god because our misfortunes are none of his doing in contrast to kushner s reading of the bible david blumenthal finds an abusing god whose sometimes evil actions evoke vigorous protest but without severing the protester s relationship with god christianity both catholic and protestant writers have addressed anger in different perspectives anger among mortals is typically seen as a sin though this contrasts against the righteous wrath of god catholic wrath is one of the seven deadly sins in catholicism and yet the catechism of the catholic church states canons 1772 and 1773 that anger is among the passions and that in the passions as movements of the sensitive appetite there is neither good nor evil the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it is directed against an innocent person when it is unduly unbending or long lasting or when it desires excessive punishment if anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor it is gravely against charity it is a mortal sin ccc 2302 hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm ccc 2302 03 medieval christianity vigorously denounced wrath as one of the seven cardinal or deadly sins but some christian writers at times regarded the anger caused by injustice as having some value saint basil viewed anger as a reprehensible temporary madness joseph f delany in the catholic encyclopedia 1914 defines anger as the desire of vengeance and states that a reasonable vengeance and passion is ethical and praiseworthy vengeance is sinful when it exceeds its limits in which case it becomes opposed to justice and charity for example vengeance upon one who has not deserved it or to a greater extent than it has been deserved or in conflict with the dispositions of law or from an improper motive are all sinful an unduly vehement vengeance is considered a venial sin unless it seriously goes counter to the love of god or of one s neighbor a more positive view of anger is espoused by roman catholic pastoral theologian henri j m nouwen father nouwen points to the spiritual benefits in anger toward god as found in both the old testament and new testament of the bible in the bible says father nouwen it is clear that only by expressing our anger and hatred directly to god will we come to know the fullness of both his love and our freedom georges bernanos illustrates nouwen s position in his novel the diary of a country priest the countess gave birth to the son she had long wanted but the child died she was fiercely angry when the priest called the countess vented her anger toward her daughter and husband then at the priest who responded gently open your heart to god the countess rejoined i ve ceased to bother about god when you ve forced me to admit that i hate him will you be any better off the priest continued you no longer hate him hate is indifference and contempt now at last you re face to face with him shake your fist at him spit in his face scourge him the countess did what the priest counseled by confessing her hate she was enabled to say all s well protestant everyone experiences anger andrew d lester observes and furthermore anger can serve as a spiritual friend a spiritual guide and a spiritual ally denying and suppressing anger is contrary to st paul s admonition in his epistle to the ephesians 4 26 when anger toward god is denied and suppressed it interferes with an individual s relation with god expressing one s anger toward god can deepen the relationship c fitzsimons allison holds that we worship god by expressing our honest anger at him biblical scholar leonard pine concludes from his studies in the book of habakkuk that far from being a sin proper remonstration with god is the activity of a healthy faith relationship with him other biblical examples of anger toward god include the following moses was angry with god for mistreating his people lord why have you mistreated lit done evil to this people book of exodus 5 22 naomi was angry with god after the death of her husband and two sons the almighty has dealt bitterly with me

people ah lord god how utterly you have deceived this people and jerusalem book of jeremiah 4 10 hinduism in hinduism anger is equated with sorrow as a form of unrequited desire the objects of anger are perceived as a hindrance to the gratification of the desires of the angry person alternatively if one thinks one is superior the result is grief anger is considered to be packed with more evil power than desire in the bhagavad gita krishna regards greed anger and lust as signs of ignorance that lead to perpetual bondage as for the agitations of the bickering mind they are divided into two divisions the first is called avirodha pr\u012bti or unrestricted attachment and the other is called virodha yukta krodha anger arising from frustration adherence to the philosophy of the m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs belief in the fruitive results of the karma v\u0101d\u012bs and belief in plans based on materialistic desires are called avirodha pr\u012bti j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs karm\u012bs and materialistic planmakers generally attract the attention of conditioned souls but when the materialists cannot fulfill their plans and when their devices are frustrated they become angry frustration of material desires produces anger buddhism anger is defined in buddhism as being unable to bear the object or the intention to cause harm to the object anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration and is listed as one of the five hindrances buddhist monks such as dalai lama the spiritual leader of tibetans in exile sometimes get angry most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled thus in response to the question is any anger acceptable in buddhism the dalai lama answered buddhism in general teaches that anger is a destructive emotion and although anger might have some positive effects in terms of survival or moral outrage i do not accept that anger of any kind as sic a virtuous emotion nor aggression as constructive behavior the gautama buddha sic has taught that there are three basic kleshas at the root of samsara bondage illusion and the vicious cycle of rebirth these are greed hatred and delusion also translatable as attachment anger and ignorance they bring us confusion and misery rather than peace happiness and fulfillment it is in our own self interest to purify and transform them buddhist scholar and author geshe kelsang gyatso has also explained buddha s teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties when things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem but in reality whatever problems we experience come from the side of the mind if we responded to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us eventually we might even regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind therefore if we want to be free from problems we must transform our mind the buddha himself on anger an angry person is ugly sleeps poorly gaining a profit he turns it into a loss having done damage with word deed a person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth maddened with anger he destroys his status relatives friends colleagues avoid him anger brings loss anger inflames the mind he doesn t realize that his danger is born from within an angry person doesn t know his own benefit an angry person doesn t see the dharma a man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness he takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good but later when his anger is gone he suffers as if burned with fire he is spoiled blotted out like fire enveloped in smoke when anger spreads when a man becomes angry he has no shame no fear of evil is not respectful in speech for a person overcome with anger nothing gives light islam a verse in the third surah of the quran instructs people to restrain their anger anger arabic \u063a\u0636\u0628 ghadab in islam is considered to be instigated by satan shaitan factors stated to lead to anger include selfishness arrogance and excessive ambition islamic teachings also state that anger hinders the faith iman of a person the quran attributes anger to prophets and believers as well as muhammad s enemies it mentions the anger of moses musa against his people for worshiping a golden calf and at the moment when moses strikes an egyptian for fighting against an israelite the anger of jonah yunus is also mentioned in the quran which led to his departure from the people of nineveh and his eventual realization of his error and his repentance the removal of anger from the hearts of believers by god arabic allah \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 all\u0101h after the fighting against muhammad s enemies is over in general suppression of anger arabic \u0643 \u0638\u0645 kazm is deemed a praiseworthy quality in the hadis ibn abdil barr the andalusian maliki jurist explains that controlling anger is the door way for restraining other blameworthy traits ego and envy since these two are less powerful than anger the hadis state various ways to diminish prevent and control anger one of these methods is to perform a ritual ablution a different narration states that the angry person should lie down and other narrations instruct the angry person to invoke god and seek refuge from the devil by reciting i take refuge with allah god from the accursed devil ali the cousin and son in law of muhammad said a moment of patience in a moment of anger saves a thousand moments of regret and anger begins with madness and ends in regret divine retribution in many religions anger is frequently attributed to god or gods primitive people held that gods were subject to anger and revenge in anthropomorphic fashion the hebrew bible says that opposition to god s will results in god s anger reform rabbi kaufmann kohler explains god is not an intellectual abstraction nor is he conceived as a being indifferent to the doings of man and his pure and lofty nature resents most energetically anything wrong and impure in the moral world o lord my god mine holy one thou art of eyes too pure to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity christians believe in god s anger at the sight of evil this anger is not inconsistent with god s love as demonstrated in the gospel where the righteous indignation of christ is shown in the cleansing of the temple see also angry cognitions scale fear indignation moral emotions outrage emotion rage emotion references further reading books articles", "Fear": "fear is an unpleasant emotion that arises in response to perceived dangers or threats fear causes physiological and psychological changes it may produce behavioral reactions such as mounting an aggressive response or fleeing the threat commonly known as the fight or flight response extreme cases of fear can trigger an immobilized freeze response fear in humans can occur in response to a present stimulus or anticipation of a future threat fear is involved in some mental disorders particularly anxiety disorders in humans and other animals fear is modulated by cognition and learning thus fear is judged as rational and appropriate or irrational and inappropriate irrational fears are phobias fear is closely related to the emotion anxiety which occurs as the result of often future threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable the fear response serves survival and has been preserved throughout evolution even simple invertebrates display an emotion akin to fear research suggests that fears are not solely dependent on their nature but also shaped by social relations and culture which guide an individual s understanding of when and how to fear physiological signs many physiological changes in the body are associated with fear summarized as the fight or flight response an innate response for coping with danger it works by accelerating the breathing rate hyperventilation heart rate vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blood pooling dilating the pupils increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing goosebumps or more clinically piloerection making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive sweating increased blood glucose hyperglycemia increased serum calcium increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes alertness leading to sleep disturbance and butterflies in the stomach dyspepsia this primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger with the series of physiological changes the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear there are observable physical reactions in individuals who experience fear an individual might experience a feeling of dizziness lightheaded like they are being choked sweating shortness of breath vomiting or nausea numbness or shaking and any other like symptoms these bodily reactions inform the individual that they are afraid and should proceed to remove or get away from the stimulus that is causing that fear causes an influential categorization of stimuli causing fear was proposed by psychologist jeffrey alan gray namely intensity novelty special evolutionary dangers stimuli arising during social interaction and conditioned stimuli another categorization was proposed by archer who besides conditioned fear stimuli categorized fear evoking as well as aggression evoking stimuli into three groups namely pain novelty and frustration although he also described looming which refers to an object rapidly moving towards the visual sensors of a subject and can be categorized as intensity russell described a more functional categorization of fear evoking stimuli in which for instance novelty is a variable affecting more than one category 1 predator stimuli including movement suddenness proximity but also learned and innate predator stimuli 2 physical environmental dangers including intensity and heights 3 stimuli associated with increased risk of predation and other dangers including novelty openness illumination and being alone 4 stimuli stemming from conspecifics including novelty movement and spacing behavior 5 species predictable fear stimuli and experience special evolutionary dangers and 6 fear stimuli that are not species predictable conditioned fear stimuli nature although many fears are learned the capacity to fear is part of human nature many studies have found that certain fears e g animals heights are much more common than others e g flowers clouds these fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory this phenomenon is known as preparedness because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of natural selection from an evolutionary psychology perspective different fears may be different adaptations that have been useful in our evolutionary past they may have developed during different time periods some fears such as fear of heights may be common to all mammals and developed during the mesozoic period other fears such as fear of snakes may be common to all simians and developed during the cenozoic time period the still ongoing geological era encompassing the last 66 million of history still others such as fear of mice and insects may be unique to humans and developed during the paleolithic and neolithic time periods when mice and insects become important carriers of infectious diseases and harmful for crops and stored foods conditioning nonhuman animals and humans innovate specific fears as a result of learning this has been studied in psychology as fear conditioning beginning with john b watson s little albert experiment in 1920 which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs in this study an 11 month old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory the fear became generalized to include other white furry objects such as a rabbit dog and even a santa claus mask with white cotton balls in the beard fear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident for example if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out he or she may develop a fear of wells heights acrophobia enclosed spaces claustrophobia or water aquaphobia there are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear when looking at these areas such as the amygdala it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma or if they have observed the fear in others in a study completed by andreas olsson katherine i nearing and elizabeth a phelps the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear provoking situation this suggests that fear can develop in both conditions not just simply from personal history fear is affected by cultural and historical context for example in the early 20th century many americans feared polio a disease that can lead to paralysis there are consistent cross cultural differences in how people respond to fear display rules affect how likely people are to express the facial expression of fear and other emotions fear of victimization is a function of perceived risk and seriousness of potential harm common triggers phobias according to surveys some of the most common fears are of demons and ghosts the existence of evil powers cockroaches spiders snakes heights water enclosed spaces tunnels bridges needles social rejection failure examinations and public speaking regionally some may more so fear terrorist attacks death war criminal or gang violence being alone the future nuclear war flying clowns intimacy people and driving uncertainty fear of the unknown or irrational fear is caused by negative thinking worry which arises from anxiety accompanied by a subjective sense of apprehension or dread irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat many people are scared of the unknown the irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter the next ten years or even tomorrow chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same for example continuation of scholarly education is perceived by many educators as a risk that may cause them fear and stress and they would rather teach things they ve been taught than go and do research the ambiguity of situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety in addition to other psychological and physical problems in some populations especially those who engage it constantly for example in war ridden places or in places of conflict terrorism abuse etc poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate a child s psyche development or personality for example parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them in school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self esteem and self confidence researchers say talking to strangers is not something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent s presence if required developing a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and as an essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies fear of the unknown fotu may be a or possibly the fundamental fear from early times when there were many threats to life behavior although fear behavior varies from species to species it is often divided into two main categories namely avoidance flight and immobility to these different researchers have added different categories such as threat display and attack protective responses including startle and looming responses defensive burying and social responses including alarm vocalizations and submission finally immobility is often divided into freezing and tonic immobility the decision as to which particular fear behavior to perform is determined by the level of fear as well as the specific context such as environmental characteristics escape route present distance to refuge the presence of a discrete and localized threat the distance between threat and subject threat characteristics speed size directness of approach the characteristics of the subject under threat size physical condition speed degree of crypsis protective morphological structures social conditions group size and the amount of experience with the type of the threat mechanism often laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses in 2004 researchers conditioned rats rattus norvegicus to fear a certain stimulus through electric shock the researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process the rats showed signs of avoidance learning not fear but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats the avoidance learning of rats is seen as a conditioned response and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned as supported by the earlier research species specific defense reactions ssdrs or avoidance learning in nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli it is how animals survive in the wild humans and animals both share these species specific defense reactions such as the flight or fight which also include pseudo aggression fake or intimidating aggression and freeze response to threats which is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system these ssdrs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species other species and interaction with the environment these acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten the animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat an example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake as with many functions of the brain there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species the amygdala communicates both directions between the prefrontal cortex hypothalamus the sensory cortex the hippocampus thalamus septum and the brainstem the amygdala plays an important role in ssdr such as the ventral amygdalofugal which is essential for associative learning and ssdrs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species an emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain and activating the sympathetic nervous systems which controls the flight fight freeze fright and faint response often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear like the human case of patient s m this impairment can cause different species to lack the sensation of fear and often can become overly confident confronting larger peers or walking up to predatory creatures robert c bolles 1970 a researcher at university of washington wanted to understand species specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools that were used to measure this tendency were out of touch with the natural world he theorized the species specific defense reaction ssdr there are three forms of ssdrs flight fight pseudo aggression or freeze even domesticated animals have ssdrs and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become wild again dr bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal and not the aversive conditioned stimuli this safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change intrinsic feedback or information coming from within muscle twitches increased heart rate are seen to be more important in ssdrs than extrinsic feedback stimuli that comes from the external environment dr bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears to help assure survival of the species rats will run away from any shocking event and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened the wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species specific defense reactions or behaviors bolles believed that ssdrs are conditioned through pavlovian conditioning and not operant conditioning ssdrs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events michael s fanselow conducted an experiment to test some specific defense reactions he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently based on instinct or defensive topography rather than contextual information species specific defense responses are created out of fear and are essential for survival rats that lack the gene stathmin show no avoidance learning or a lack of fear and will often walk directly up to cats and be eaten animals use these ssdrs to continue living to help increase their chance of fitness by surviving long enough to procreate humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided and this fear can be learned through association with others in the community or learned through personal experience with a creature species or situations that should be avoided ssdrs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats chimpanzees prairie dogs and even humans an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world fear learning changes across the lifetime due to natural developmental changes in the brain this includes changes in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala the visual exploration of an emotional face does not follow a fixed pattern but modulated by the emotional content of the face scheller et al found that participants paid more attention to the eyes when recognising fearful or neutral faces while the mouth was fixated on when happy faces are presented irrespective of task demands and spatial locations of face stimuli these findings were replicated when fearful eyes are presented and when canonical face configurations are distorted for fearful neutral and happy expressions neurocircuitry in mammals the thalamus collects sensory data from the senses sensory cortex receives data from the thalamus and interprets it sensory cortex organizes information for dissemination to the hypothalamus fight or flight amygdalae fear hippocampus memory the brain structures that are the center of most neurobiological events associated with fear are the two amygdalae located behind the pituitary gland each amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning they are essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory in the presence of a threatening stimulus the amygdalae generate the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression once a response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences the amygdalae may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness in which they are ready to move run fight etc this defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight or flight response regulated by the hypothalamus part of the limbic system once the person is in safe mode meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them the amygdalae will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex mpfc where it is stored for similar future situations which is known as memory consolidation some of the hormones involved during the state of fight or flight include epinephrine which regulates heart rate and metabolism as well as dilating blood vessels and air passages norepinephrine increasing heart rate blood flow to skeletal muscles and the release of glucose from energy stores and cortisol which increases blood sugar increases circulating neutrophilic leukocytes calcium amongst other things after a situation which incites fear occurs the amygdalae and hippocampus record the event through synaptic plasticity the stimulation to the hippocampus will cause the individual to remember many details surrounding the situation plasticity and memory formation in the amygdala are generated by activation of the neurons in the region experimental data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity of the neurons leading to the lateral amygdalae occurs with fear conditioning in some cases this forms permanent fear responses such as post traumatic stress disorder ptsd or a phobia mri and fmri scans have shown that the amygdalae in individuals diagnosed with such disorders including bipolar or panic disorder are larger and wired for a higher level of fear pathogens can suppress amygdala activity rats infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite become less fearful of cats sometimes even seeking out their urine marked areas this behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats the parasite then reproduces within the body of the cat there is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats in a separate experiment rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli these rats pulled on levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks while they learned to avoid pressing on them they did not distance themselves from these shock inducing levers several brain structures other than the amygdalae have also been observed to be activated when individuals are presented with fearful vs neutral faces namely the occipitocerebellar regions including the fusiform gyrus and the inferior parietal superior temporal gyri fearful eyes brows and mouth seem to separately reproduce these brain responses scientists from zurich studies show that the hormone oxytocin related to stress and sex reduces activity in your brain fear center pheromones and contagion in threatening situations insects aquatic organisms birds reptiles and mammals emit odorant substances initially called alarm substances which are chemical signals now called alarm pheromones this is to defend themselves and at the same time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing defensive behavior or dispersion depending on circumstances and species for example stressed rats release odorant cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal after the discovery of pheromones in 1959 alarm pheromones were first described in 1968 in ants and earthworms and four years later also found in mammals both mice and rats over the next two decades identification and characterization of these pheromones proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals including fish but it was not until 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm pheromones was gleaned in 1985 a link between odors released by stressed rats and pain perception was discovered unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid mediated analgesia in 1997 researchers found that bees became less responsive to pain after they had been stimulated with isoamyl acetate a chemical smelling of banana and a component of bee alarm pheromone the experiment also showed that the bees fear induced pain tolerance was mediated by an endorphin by using the forced swimming test in rats as a model of fear induction the first mammalian alarm substance was found in 1991 this alarm substance was shown to fulfill criteria for pheromones well defined behavioral effect species specificity minimal influence of experience and control for nonspecific arousal rat activity testing with the alarm pheromone and their preference avoidance for odors from cylinders containing the pheromone showed that the pheromone had very low volatility in 1993 a connection between alarm chemosignals in mice and their immune response was found pheromone production in mice was found to be associated with or mediated by the pituitary gland in 1994 in 2004 it was demonstrated that rats alarm pheromones had different effects on the recipient rat the rat perceiving the pheromone depending which body region they were released from pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat e g caused sniffing or movement whereas pheromone secreted from the rat s anal area induced autonomic nervous system stress responses like an increase in core body temperature further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior and its acoustic startle reflex was enhanced it was not until 2011 that a link between severe pain neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found real time rt pcr analysis of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of proinflammatory cytokines in deep brain structures namely of il 1\u03b2 heteronuclear corticotropin releasing hormone and c fos mrna expressions in both the paraventricular nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma corticosterone the neurocircuit for how rats perceive alarm pheromones was shown to be related to the hypothalamus brainstem and amygdalae all of which are evolutionary ancient structures deep inside or in the case of the brainstem underneath the brain away from the cortex and involved in the fight or flight response as is the case in humans alarm pheromone induced anxiety in rats has been used to evaluate the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans for this the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone induced anxiety i e reduction of defensiveness has been measured pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety namely midazolam phenelzine a nonselective monoamine oxidase mao inhibitor propranolol a nonselective beta blocker clonidine an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist or cp 154 526 a corticotropin releasing hormone antagonist faulty development of odor discrimination impairs the perception of pheromones and pheromone related behavior like aggressive behavior and mating in male rats the enzyme mitogen activated protein kinase 7 mapk7 has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains but absent in most regions of adult rat brains conditional deletion of the mapk7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone mediated behaviors including aggression and mating in male mice these behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone by physical immobility by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression using mouse urine as a natural pheromone containing solution it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities lastly alleviation of an acute fear response because a friendly peer or in biological language an affiliative conspecific tends and befriends is called social buffering the term is in analogy to the 1985 buffering hypothesis in psychology where social support has been proven to mitigate the negative health effects of alarm pheromone mediated distress the role of a social pheromone is suggested by the recent discovery that olfactory signals are responsible in mediating the social buffering in male rats social buffering was also observed to mitigate the conditioned fear responses of honeybees a bee colony exposed to an environment of high threat of predation did not show increased aggression and aggressive like gene expression patterns in individual bees but decreased aggression that the bees did not simply habituate to threats is suggested by the fact that the disturbed colonies also decreased their foraging biologists have proposed in 2012 that fear pheromones evolved as molecules of keystone significance a term coined in analogy to keystone species pheromones may determine species compositions and affect rates of energy and material exchange in an ecological community thus pheromones generate structure in a food web and play critical roles in maintaining natural systems humans evidence of chemosensory alarm signals in humans has emerged slowly although alarm pheromones have not been physically isolated and their chemical structures have not been identified in humans so far there is evidence for their presence androstadienone for example a steroidal endogenous odorant is a pheromone candidate found in human sweat axillary hair and plasma the closely related compound androstenone is involved in communicating dominance aggression or competition sex hormone influences on androstenone perception in humans showed a high testosterone level related to heightened androstenone sensitivity in men a high testosterone level related to unhappiness in response to androstenone in men and a high estradiol level related to disliking of androstenone in women a german study from 2006 showed when anxiety induced versus exercise induced human sweat from a dozen people was pooled and offered to seven study participants of five able to olfactorily distinguish exercise induced sweat from room air three could also distinguish exercise induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat the acoustic startle reflex response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise induced sweat as measured by electromyography analysis of the orbital muscle which is responsible for the eyeblink component this showed for the first time that fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation fear chemosignals primed the recipient s defensive behavior prior to the subjects conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level in analogy to the social buffering of rats and honeybees in response to chemosignals induction of empathy by smelling anxiety of another person has been found in humans a study from 2013 provided brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender specific researchers collected alarm induced sweat and exercise induced sweat from donors extracted it pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain mri while stress induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males stress induced sweat from females produced markedly stronger arousal in women than in men statistical tests pinpointed this gender specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei since no significant differences were found in the olfactory bulb the response to female fear induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning i e on the emotional level rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender i e the perceptual level an approach avoidance task was set up where volunteers seeing either an angry or a happy cartoon face on a computer screen pushed away or pulled toward them a joystick as fast as possible volunteers smelling androstadienone masked with clove oil scent responded faster especially to angry faces than those smelling clove oil only which was interpreted as androstadienone related activation of the fear system a potential mechanism of action is that androstadienone alters the emotional face processing androstadienone is known to influence the activity of the fusiform gyrus which is relevant for face recognition cognitive consistency theory cognitive consistency theories assume that when two or more simultaneously active cognitive structures are logically inconsistent arousal is increased which activates processes with the expected consequence of increasing consistency and decreasing arousal in this context it has been proposed that fear behavior is caused by an inconsistency between a preferred or expected situation and the actually perceived situation and functions to remove the inconsistent stimulus from the perceptual field for instance by fleeing or hiding thereby resolving the inconsistency this approach puts fear in a broader perspective also involving aggression and curiosity when the inconsistency between perception and expectancy is small learning as a result of curiosity reduces inconsistency by updating expectancy to match perception if the inconsistency is larger fear or aggressive behavior may be employed to alter the perception in order to make it match expectancy depending on the size of the inconsistency as well as the specific context aggressive behavior is assumed to alter perception by forcefully manipulating it into matching the expected situation while in some cases thwarted escape may also trigger aggressive behavior in an attempt to remove the thwarting stimulus research in order to improve our understanding of the neural and behavioral mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive fear investigators use a variety of translational animal models these models are particularly important for research that would be too invasive for human studies rodents such as mice and rats are common animal models but other species are used certain aspects of fear research still requires more research such as sex gender and age differences models these animal models include but are not limited to fear conditioning predator based psychosocial stress single prolonged stress chronic stress models inescapable foot tail shocks immobilization or restraint and stress enhanced fear learning while the stress and fear paradigms differ between the models they tend to involve aspects such as acquisition generalization extinction cognitive regulation and reconsolidation pavlovian fear conditioning also known as pavlovian or classical conditioning is a process of learning that involves pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditional stimulus us a neutral stimulus is something like a bell tone or room that does not elicit a response normally where a us is a stimulus that results in a natural or unconditioned response ur in pavlov s famous experiment the neutral stimulus is a bell and the us would be food with the dog s salvation being the ur pairing the neutral stimulus and the us results in the ur occurring not only with the us but also the neutral stimulus when this occurs the neutral stimulus is referred to as the conditional stimulus cs and the response the conditional response cr in the fear conditioning model of pavlovian conditioning the us is an aversive stimulus such as a shock tone or unpleasant odor predator based psychosocial stress predator based psychosocial stress pps involves a more naturalistic approach to fear learning predators such as a cat a snake or urine from a fox or cat are used along with other stressors such as immobilization or restraint in order to generate instinctual fear responses chronic stress models chronic stress models include chronic variable stress chronic social defeat and chronic mild stress these models are often used to study how long term or prolonged stress pain can alter fear learning and disorders single prolonged stress single prolonged stress sps is a fear model that is often used to study ptsd its paradigm involves multiple stressors such as immobilization a force swim and exposure to ether delivered concurrently to the subject this is used to study non naturalistic uncontrollable situations that can cause a maladaptive fear responses that is seen in a lot of anxiety and traumatic based disorders stress enhanced fear learning stress enhanced fear learning sefl like sps is often used to study the maladaptive fear learning involved in ptsd and other traumatic based disorders sefl involves a single extreme stressor such as a large number of footshocks simulating a single traumatic stressor that somehow enhances and alters future fear learning management pharmaceutical a drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobias via the amygdalae is the use of glucocorticoids in one study glucocorticoid receptors in the central nuclei of the amygdalae were disrupted in order to better understand the mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning the glucocorticoid receptors were inhibited using lentiviral vectors containing cre recombinase injected into mice results showed that disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors prevented conditioned fear behavior the mice were subjected to auditory cues which caused them to freeze normally a reduction of freezing was observed in the mice that had inhibited glucocorticoid receptors psychological cognitive behavioral therapy has been successful in helping people overcome their fear because fear is more complex than just forgetting or deleting memories an active and successful approach involves people repeatedly confronting their fears by confronting their fears in a safe manner a person can suppress the fear triggering memories or stimuli exposure therapy has known to have helped up to 90 of people with specific phobias to significantly decrease their fear over time another psychological treatment is systematic desensitization which is a type of behavior therapy used to completely remove the fear or produce a disgusted response to this fear and replace it the replacement that occurs will be relaxation and will occur through conditioning through conditioning treatments muscle tensioning will lessen and deep breathing techniques will aid in de tensioning literary and religious there are other methods for treating or coping with one s fear such as writing down rational thoughts regarding fears journal entries are a healthy method of expressing one s fears without compromising safety or causing uncertainty another suggestion is a fear ladder to create a fear ladder one must write down all of their fears and score them on a scale of one to ten next the person addresses their phobia starting with the lowest number religion can help some individuals cope with fear incapability people who have damage to their amygdalae which can be caused by a rare genetic disease known as urbach wiethe disease are unable to experience fear the disease destroys both amygdalae in late childhood since the discovery of the disease there have only been 400 recorded cases a lack of fear can allow someone to get into a dangerous situation they otherwise would have avoided society and culture death the fear of the end of life and its existence is in other words the fear of death historically attempts were made to reduce this fear by performing rituals which have helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present these rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas the results and methods of human existence had been changing at the same time that social formation was changing when people are faced with their own thoughts of death they either accept that they are dying or will die because they have lived a full life or they will experience fear a theory was developed in response to this which is called the terror management theory the theory states that a person s cultural worldviews religion values etc will mitigate the terror associated with the fear of death through avoidance to help manage their terror they find solace in their death denying beliefs such as their religion another way people cope with their death related fears is pushing any thoughts of death into the future or by avoiding these thoughts all together through distractions although there are methods for one coping with the terror associated with their fear of death not everyone suffers from these same uncertainties people who believe they have lived life to the fullest typically do not fear death death anxiety is multidimensional it covers fears related to one s own death the death of others fear of the unknown after death fear of obliteration and fear of the dying process which includes fear of a slow death and a painful death the yale philosopher shelly kagan examined fear of death in a 2007 yale open course by examining the following questions is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response what conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death what is meant by fear and how much fear is appropriate according to kagan for fear in general to make sense three conditions should be met the object of fear needs to be something bad there needs to be a non negligible chance that the bad state of affairs will happen there needs to be some uncertainty about the bad state of affairs the amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of the bad if the three conditions are not met fear is an inappropriate emotion he argues that death does not meet the first two criteria even if death is a deprivation of good things and even if one believes in a painful afterlife because death is certain it also does not meet the third criterion but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies may be cause to a sense of fear in a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men aged 65 87 low self efficacy predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics social support and physical health fear of death was measured by a multidimensional fear of death scale which included the 8 subscales fear of dying fear of the dead fear of being destroyed fear for significant others fear of the unknown fear of conscious death fear for the body after death and fear of premature death in hierarchical multiple regression analysis the most potent predictors of death fears were low spiritual health efficacy defined as beliefs relating to one s perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength and low instrumental efficacy defined as beliefs relating to one s perceived ability to manage activities of daily living psychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear with equivocal results religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment intrinsic religiosity as opposed to mere formal religious involvement has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety in a 1976 study of people of various christian denominations those who were most firm in their faith who attended religious services weekly were the least afraid of dying the survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and religious concern in a 2006 study of white christian men and women the hypothesis was tested that traditional church centered religiousness and de institutionalized spiritual seeking are ways of approaching fear of death in old age both religiousness and spirituality were related to positive psychosocial functioning but only church centered religiousness protected subjects against the fear of death religion statius in the thebaid book 3 line 661 aired the irreverent suggestion that fear first made gods in the world from a christian theological perspective the word fear can encompass more than simple dread robert b strimple says that fear includes the convergence of awe reverence adoration humility some translations of the bible such as the new international version sometimes express the concept of fear with the word reverence a similar phrase god fearing is sometimes used as a rough synonym for pious it is a standard translation for the arabic word taqwa arabic \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0649 forbearance restraint in muslim contexts in judaism fear of god describes obedience to jewish law even when invisible to others manipulation fear may be politically and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which would otherwise be widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be widely supported in contexts of disasters nation states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities but also to adjust their previous beliefs fear can alter how a person thinks or reacts to situations because fear has the power to inhibit one s rational way of thinking as a result people who do not experience fear are able to use fear as a tool to manipulate others people who are experiencing fear seek preservation through safety and can be manipulated by a person who is there to provide that safety that is being sought after when we re afraid a manipulator can talk us out of the truth we see right in front of us words become more real than reality by this a manipulator can use our fear to manipulate us out the truth and instead make us believe and trust in their truth politicians are notorious for using fear to manipulate the people into supporting their policies this strategy taps into primal human emotions leveraging fear of the unknown external threats or perceived dangers to influence decision making fiction and mythology fear is found and reflected in mythology and folklore as well as in works of fiction such as novels and films works of dystopian and post apocalyptic fiction convey the fears and anxieties of societies the fear of the world s end is about as old as civilization itself in a 1967 study frank kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode scientific and critical thought supplanting religious and mythical thought as well as a public emancipation may be the cause of eschatology becoming replaced by more realistic scenarios such might constructively provoke discussion and steps to be taken to prevent depicted catastrophes the story of the youth who went forth to learn what fear was is a german fairy tale dealing with the topic of not knowing fear many stories also include characters who fear the antagonist of the plot one important characteristic of historical and mythical heroes across cultures is to be fearless in the face of big and often lethal enemies the magnus archives is a fiction horror podcast written by jonathan sims and directed by alexander j newall that among other things formulates an archetypal ontology of fear through the dissemination of case files at a paranormal research institute set in a world where the metaphysical basis of paranormal activity and unexplainable horrors is fear incarnate the diegesis states that true categorization of fear is impossible that fear is all one unknowable thing however there exists an ontological structure of fear archetypes in this universe proposed by a fictional version of the architect robert smirke it is a unique construction of fear in that it is not based on the science or neurology of fear but on thematic and experiential connections between different phobias for example the fear of disease and vermin comes from the same place as the fear of abusive relationships as both lie in fearing corruptions to the self the final season of the podcast consists almost entirely of poetic meditations on the nature of fear fear in art has been explored by the japanese scholar kyoko nakano in a series of books and a 2017 exhibition about kowai e lit scary pictures athletics in the world of athletics fear is often used as a means of motivation to not fail this situation involves using fear in a way that increases the chances of a positive outcome in this case the fear that is being created is initially a cognitive state to the receiver this initial state is what generates the first response of the athlete this response generates a possibility of fight or flight reaction by the athlete receiver which in turn will increase or decrease the possibility of success or failure in the certain situation for the athlete the amount of time that the athlete has to determine this decision is small but it is still enough time for the receiver to make a determination through cognition even though the decision is made quickly the decision is determined through past events that have been experienced by the athlete the results of these past events will determine how the athlete will make his cognitive decision in the split second that he or she has fear of failure as described above has been studied frequently in the field of sport psychology many scholars have tried to determine how often fear of failure is triggered within athletes as well as what personalities of athletes most often choose to use this type of motivation studies have also been conducted to determine the success rate of this method of motivation murray s exploration in personal 1938 was one of the first studies that actually identified fear of failure as an actual motive to avoid failure or to achieve success his studies suggested that inavoidance the need to avoid failure was found in many college aged men during the time of his research in 1938 this was a monumental finding in the field of psychology because it allowed other researchers to better clarify how fear of failure can actually be a determinant of creating achievement goals as well as how it could be used in the actual act of achievement in the context of sport a model was created by r s lazarus in 1991 that uses the cognitive motivational relational theory of emotion it holds that fear of failure results when beliefs or cognitive schemas about aversive consequences of failing are activated by situations in which failure is possible these belief systems predispose the individual to make appraisals of threat and experience the state anxiety that is associated with fear of failure in evaluative situations another study was done in 2001 by conroy poczwardowski and henschen that created five aversive consequences of failing that have been repeated over time the five categories include a experiencing shame and embarrassment b devaluing one s self estimate c having an uncertain future d important others losing interest e upsetting important others these five categories can help one infer the possibility of an individual to associate failure with one of these threat categories which will lead them to experiencing fear of failure in summary the two studies that were done above created a more precise definition of fear of failure which is a dispositional tendency to experience apprehension and anxiety in evaluative situations because individuals have learned that failure is associated with aversive consequences the author and internet content creator john green wrote about the yips a common colloquialism for a debilitating often chronic manifestation of athletic anxiety experienced by some professional athletes in an essay for his podcast and novel the anthropocene reviewed green discusses famous examples of when athletic anxiety has ruined careers and juxtaposes it with the nature of general anxiety as a whole green settles however on a conclusion for the essay evoking resilience and hope in the human condition by describing a circumstance where the baseball player rick ankiel reset his career back to the minor leagues

which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions this includes the core meaning as held in the originating old english word weal which is from an indo european word stem the modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics and clearly so for growth economics and development economics yet the meaning of wealth is context dependent a person possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy net worth is defined as the current value of one s assets less liabilities excluding the principal in trust accounts at the most general level economists may define wealth as the total of anything of value that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various people in different contexts defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own a community region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy the united nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural human and physical assets natural capital includes land forests energy resources and minerals human capital is the population s education and skills physical or manufactured capital includes such things as machinery buildings and infrastructure history around 35 000 years ago homo sapiens groups began to adopt a more settled lifestyle as evidenced by cave drawings burial sites and decorative objects around this time humans began trading burial site tools and developed trade networks resulting in a hunter gatherer lifestyle those who had gathered abundant burial site tools weapons baskets and food were considered part of the wealthy adam smith in his seminal work the wealth of nations described wealth as the annual produce of the land and labor of the society this produce is at its simplest a good or service which satisfies human needs and wants of utility in popular usage wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value or the state of controlling or possessing such items usually in the form of money real estate and personal property a person considered wealthy affluent or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group in economics net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time wealth can be categorized into three principal categories personal property including homes or automobiles monetary savings such as the accumulation of past income and the capital wealth of income producing assets including real estate stocks bonds and businesses all these delineations make wealth an especially important part of social stratification wealth provides some people safety nets of protection against unforeseen declines in their living standard in the event of emergency and can be transformed into home ownership business ownership or college education by its expenditure wealth has been defined as a collection of things limited in supply transferable and useful in satisfying human desires scarcity is a fundamental factor for wealth when a desirable or valuable commodity transferable good or skill is abundantly available to everyone the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth when a valuable or desirable commodity is in scarce supply the owner of the commodity will possess great potential for wealth wealth refers to some accumulation of resources net asset value whether abundant or not richness refers to an abundance of such resources income or flow a wealthy person group or nation thus has more accumulated resources capital than a poor one the opposite of wealth is destitution the opposite of richness is poverty the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner the concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies but varies between different sections or regions in the same society a personal net worth of us 10 000 in most parts of the united states would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished developing countries concepts of wealth also vary across time modern labor saving inventions and the development of the sciences have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future given this trend of human advancement it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations industrialization emphasized the role of technology many jobs were automated machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized labour specialization became critical to economic success physical capital as it came to be known consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials labour land and technology the theories of david ricardo john locke john stuart mill in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics marxian economics see labor theory of value distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth defining human wealth as wealth in human relations land and labour were the source of all material wealth the german cultural historian silvio vietta links wealth poverty to rationality having a leading position in the development of rational sciences in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth while the opposite can be correlated with poverty global amount the wealth of households worldwide amounts to us 280 trillion 2017 according to the eighth edition of the global wealth report in the year to mid 2017 total global wealth rose at a rate of 6 4 the fastest pace since 2012 and reached us 280 trillion a gain of us 16 7 trillion this reflected widespread gains in equity markets matched by similar rises in non financial assets which moved above the pre crisis year 2007 s level for the first time this year wealth growth also outpaced population growth so that global mean wealth per adult grew by 4 9 and reached a new record high of us 56 540 per adult tim harford has asserted that a small child has greater wealth than the 2 billion poorest people in the world combined since a small child has no debt according to the 2021 global wealth report by mckinsey company the worldwide total net worth is currently at us 514 trillion in 2020 with china being the wealthiest nation with net worth of us 120 trillion another report by credit suisse in 2021 suggests the total wealth of the us exceeded that of china us 126 3 trillion to us 74 9 trillion philosophical analysis in western civilization wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought invented in the ancient greek revolution of rationality involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature the rationalization of warfare and measurement in economics the invention of coined money and banking was particularly important aristotle describes the basic function of money as a universal instrument of quantitative measurement for it measures all things making things alike and comparable due to a social agreement of acceptance in that way money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities such as gold and money modern philosophers like nietzsche criticized the fixation on measurable wealth unsere reichen das sind die \u00e4rmsten der eigentliche zweck alles reichtums ist vergessen our rich people those are the poorest the real purpose of all wealth has been forgotten economic analysis in economics wealth in a commonly applied accounting sense sometimes savings is the net worth of a person household or nation that is the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time for national wealth as measured in the national accounts the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world the term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to poverty analytical emphasis may be on its determinants or distribution economic terminology distinguishes between wealth and income wealth or savings is a stock variable that is it is measurable at a date in time for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard for a given amount of wealth say at the beginning of the year income from that wealth as measurable over say a year is a flow variable what marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year in macroeconomic theory the wealth effect may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth one feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one percent change in wealth there are several historical developmental economics points of view on the basis of wealth such as from principles of political economy by john stuart mill the wealth of nations by adam smith capital by karl marx etc over the history some of the key underlying factors in wealth creation and the measurement of the wealth include the scalable innovation and application of human knowledge in the form of institutional structure and political ideological superstructure the scarce resources both natural and man made and the saving of monetary assets wealth may be measured in nominal or real values that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes the assets include those that are tangible land and capital and financial money bonds etc measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as human capital and social capital in economics wealth corresponds to the accounting term net worth but is measured differently accounting measures net worth in terms of the historical cost of assets while economics measures wealth in terms of current values but analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting such as in national accounts an example of the latter is generational accounting of social security systems to include the present value projected future outlays considered to be liabilities macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects investment and consumption through the wealth effect environmental assets are not usually counted in measuring wealth in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a non market good environmental or green accounting is a method of social accounting for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero as the implied valuation of environmental assets versus social class social class is not identical to wealth but the two concepts are related particularly in marxist theory leading to the concept of socioeconomic status wealth at the individual or household level refers to value of everything a person or family owns including personal property and financial assets in both marxist and weberian theory class is divided into upper middle and lower with each further subdivided e g upper middle class the upper class are schooled to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations the middle class views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion this class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement they earn a significant income and consume many things typically limiting their savings and investments to retirement pensions and home ownership below the middle class the working class and poor have the least amount of wealth with circumstances discouraging accumulation of assets distribution although precise data are not available the total household wealth in the world excluding the value of human capital has been estimated at 418 3 trillion us 418 3 1012 at the end of the year 2020 for 2018 the world bank estimated the value of the world s produced capital natural capital and human capital to be 1 152 trillion according to the kuznets curve inequality of wealth and income increases during the early phases of economic development stabilizes and then becomes more equitable as of 2008 about 90 of global wealth is distributed in north america europe and rich asia pacific countries and in 2008 1 of adults were estimated to hold 40 of world wealth a number which falls to 32 when adjusted for purchasing power parity according to richard h ropers the concentration of wealth in the united states is inequitably distributed in 2013 1 of adults were estimated to hold 46 of world wealth and around 18 5 trillion was estimated to be

unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority the term crime does not in modern criminal law have any simple and universally accepted definition though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes the most popular view is that crime is a category created by law in other words something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law one proposed definition is that a crime or offence or criminal offence is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community society or the state a public wrong such acts are forbidden and punishable by law the notion that acts such as murder rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide what precisely is a criminal offence is defined by the criminal law of each relevant jurisdiction while many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code in some common law nations no such comprehensive statute exists the state government has the power to severely restrict one s liberty for committing a crime in modern societies there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere if found guilty an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence or depending on the nature of their offence to undergo imprisonment life imprisonment or in some jurisdictions death usually to be classified as a crime the act of doing something criminal actus reus must with certain exceptions be accompanied by the intention to do something criminal mens rea while every crime violates the law not every violation of the law counts as a crime breaches of private law torts and breaches of contract are not automatically punished by the state but can be enforced through civil procedure definition the exact definition of crime is a philosophical issue without an agreed upon answer fields such as law politics sociology and psychology define crime in different ways crimes may be variously considered as wrongs against individuals against the community or against the state the criminality of an action is dependent on its context acts of violence will be seen as crimes in many circumstances but as permissible or desirable in others crime was historically seen as a manifestation of evil but this has been superseded by modern criminal theories legalism legal and political definitions of crime consider actions that are banned by authorities or punishable by law crime is defined by the criminal law of a given jurisdiction including all actions that are subject to criminal procedure there is no limit to what can be considered a crime in a legal system so there may not be a unifying principle used to determine whether an action should be designated as a crime from a legal perspective crimes are generally wrong actions that are severe enough to warrant punishment that infringes on the perpetrator s liberties english criminal law and the related common law of commonwealth countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years without any actual legislation common law offences the courts used the concept of malum in se to develop various common law offences sociology as a sociological concept crime is associated with actions that cause harm and violate social norms under this definition crime is a type of social construct and societal attitudes determine what is considered criminal in legal systems based on legal moralism the predominant moral beliefs of society determine the legal definition as well as the social definition of crime this system is less prominent in liberal democratic societies that prioritize individualism and multiculturalism over other moral beliefs paternalism defines crime not only as harm to others or to society but also as harm to the self psychology psychological definitions consider the state of mind of perpetrators and their relationship with their environment history early history restrictions on behavior existed in all prehistoric societies crime in early human society was seen as a personal transgression and was addressed by the community as a whole rather than through a formal legal system often through the use of custom religion or the rule of a tribal leader some of the oldest extant writings are ancient criminal codes the earliest known criminal code was the code of ur nammu c 2100 c 2050 bc and the first known criminal code that incorporated retaliatory justice was the code of hammurabi the latter influenced the conception of crime across several civilizations over the following millennia the romans systematized law and applied their system across the roman empire the initial rules of roman law regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation the most significant roman law concept involved dominion most acts recognized as crimes in ancient societies such as violence and theft have persisted to the modern era the criminal justice system of imperial china existed unbroken for over 2 000 years many of the earliest conceptions of crime are associated with sin and corresponded to acts that were believed to invoke the anger of a deity this idea was further popularized with the development of the abrahamic religions the understanding of crime and sin were closely associated with one another for much of history and conceptions of crime took on many of the ideas associated with sin islamic law developed its own system of criminal justice as islam spread in the seventh and eighth centuries post classical era in post classical europe and east asia central government was limited and crime was defined locally towns established their own criminal justice systems while crime in the countryside was defined by the social hierarchies of feudalism in some places such as the russian empire and the kingdom of italy feudal justice survived into the 19th century common law first developed in england under the rule of henry ii in the 12th century he established a system of traveling judges that tried accused criminals in each region of england by applying precedent from previous rulings legal developments in 12th century england also resulted in the earliest known recording of official crime data modern era in the modern era crime came to be seen as an issue affecting society rather than conflicts between individuals writers such as thomas hobbes saw crime as a societal issue as early as the 17th century imprisonment developed as a long term penalty for crime in the 18th century increasing urbanization and industrialization in the 19th century caused crime to become an immediate issue that affected society prompting government intervention in crime and the establishment of criminology as its own field anthropological criminology was popularized by cesare lombroso in the late 19th century this was a biological determinist school of thought based in social darwinism arguing that certain people are naturally born as criminals the eugenics movement of the early 20th century similarly held that crime was caused primarily by genetic factors the concept of crime underwent a period of change as modernism was widely accepted in the years following world war ii crime increasingly came to be seen as a societal issue and criminal law was seen as a means to protect the public from antisocial behavior this idea was associated with a larger trend in the western world toward social democracy and centre left politics through most of history reporting of crime was generally local the advent of mass media through radio and television in the mid 20th century allowed for the sensationalism of crime this created well known stories of criminals such as jeffrey dahmer and it allowed for dramatization that perpetuates misconceptions about crime forensic science was popularized in the 1980s establishing dna profiling as a new method to prevent and analyze crime criminal law virtually all countries in the 21st century have criminal law grounded in civil law common law islamic law or socialist law historically criminal codes have often divided criminals by class or caste prescribing different penalties depending on status in some tribal societies an entire clan is recognized as liable for a crime in many cases disputes over a crime in this system lead to a feud that lasts over several generations criminalization the state determines what actions are considered criminal in the scope of the law criminalization has significant human rights considerations as it can infringe on rights of autonomy and subject individuals to unjust punishment law enforcement the enforcement of criminal law seeks to prevent crime and sanction crimes that do occur this enforcement is carried out by the state through law enforcement agencies such as police which are empowered to arrest suspected perpetrators of crimes law enforcement may focus on policing individual crimes or it may focus on bringing down overall crime rates one common variant community policing seeks to prevent crime by integrating police into the community and public life criminal procedure when the perpetrator of a crime is found guilty of the crime the state delivers a sentence to determine the penalty for the crime liability if a crime is committed the individual responsible is considered to be liable for the crime for liability to exist the individual must be capable of understanding the criminal process and the relevant authority must have legitimate power to establish what constitutes a crime international criminal law international criminal law typically addresses serious offenses such as genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes as with all international law these laws are created through treaties and international custom and they are defined through the consensus of the involved states international crimes are not prosecuted through a standard legal system though international organizations may establish tribunals to investigate and rule on egregious offenses such as genocide types white collar crime white collar crime refers to financially motivated nonviolent or non directly violent crime committed by individuals businesses and government professionals the crimes are believed to be committed by middle or upper class individuals for financial gains typical white collar crimes could include wage theft fraud bribery ponzi schemes insider trading labor racketeering embezzlement cybercrime copyright infringement money laundering identity theft and forgery blue collar crime blue collar crime is any crime committed by an individual from a lower social class as opposed to white collar crime which is associated with crime committed by someone of a higher level social class these crimes are primarily small scale for immediate beneficial gain to the individual or group involved in them examples of blue collar crime include narcotic production or distribution sexual assault theft burglary assault or murder violent crime violent crime is crime that involves an act of violent aggression against another person common examples of violent crime include homicide assault sexual assault and robbery some violent crimes such as assault may be committed with the intention of causing harm other violent crimes such as robbery may use violence to further another goal violent crime is distinct from noncriminal types of violence such as self defense use of force and acts of war acts of violence are most often perceived as deviant when they are committed as an overreaction or a disproportionate response to provocation property crime common examples of property crime include burglary theft and vandalism examples of financial crimes include counterfeiting smuggling tax evasion and bribery the scope of financial crimes has expanded significantly since the beginning of modern economics in the 17th century in occupational crime the complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations the victims of the most costly scams include banks brokerage houses insurance companies and other large financial institutions public order crime public order crime is crime that violates a society s norms about what constitutes socially acceptable behavior examples of public order crimes include gambling drug related crime public intoxication prostitution loitering breach of the peace panhandling vagrancy street harassment excessive noise and littering public order crime is associated with the broken windows theory which posits that public order crimes increase the likelihood of other types of crime some public order crimes are considered victimless crimes in which no specific victim can be identified most nations in the western world have moved toward decriminalization of victimless crimes in the modern era adultery fornication blasphemy apostasy and invoking the name of god are commonly recognized as crimes in theocratic societies or those heavily influenced by religion political crime political crime is crime that directly challenges or threatens the state examples of political crimes include subversion rebellion treason mutiny espionage sedition terrorism riot and unlawful assembly political crimes are associated with the political agenda of a given state and they are necessarily applied against political dissidents due to their unique relation to the state political crimes are often encouraged by one nation against another and it is political alignment rather than the act itself that determines criminality state crime that is carried out by the state to repress law abiding citizens may also be considered political crime inchoate crime inchoate crime is crime that is carried out in anticipation of other illegal actions but does not cause direct harm examples of inchoate crimes include attempt and conspiracy inchoate crimes are defined by substantial action to facilitate a crime with the intention of the crime s occurrence this is distinct from simple preparation for or consideration of criminal activity they are unique in that renunciation of criminal intention is generally enough to absolve the perpetrator of criminal liability as their actions are no longer facilitating a potential future crime participants criminal a criminal is an individual who commits a crime what constitutes a criminal can vary depending on the context and the law and it often carries a pejorative connotation criminals are often seen as embodying certain stereotypes or traits and are seen as a distinct type of person from law abiding citizens despite this no mental or physical trend is identifiable that differentiates criminals from non criminals public response to criminals may be indignant or sympathetic indignant responses involve resentment and a desire for vengeance wishing to see criminals removed from society or made to suffer for harm that they cause sympathetic responses involve compassion and understanding seeking to rehabilitate or forgive criminals and absolve them of blame victim a victim is an individual who has been treated unjustly or made to suffer in the context of crime the victim is the individual that is harmed by a violation of criminal law victimization is associated with post traumatic stress and a long term decrease in quality of life victimology is the study of victims including their role in crime and how they are affected several factors affect an individual s likelihood of becoming a victim some factors may cause victims of crime to experience short term or long term repeat victimization common long term victims are those that have close relationships with the criminal manifesting in crimes such as domestic violence embezzlement child abuse and bullying repeat victimization may also occur when a potential victim appears to be a viable target such as when indicating wealth in a less affluent region many of the traits that indicate criminality also indicate victimality victims of crime are more likely to engage in unlawful behavior and respond to provocation overall demographic trends of victims and criminals are often similar and victims are more likely to have engaged in criminal activities themselves the victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for deterrence victims on their own may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system let alone to collect any fines levied by a court historically from ancient times until the 19th century many societies believed that non human animals were capable of committing crimes and prosecuted and punished them accordingly prosecutions of animals gradually dwindled during the 19th century although a few were recorded as late as the 1910s and 1920s crime statistics information and statistics about crime in a given jurisdiction are collected as crime estimates typically produced by national or international agencies methods to collect crime statistics may vary even between jurisdictions within the same nation under reporting of crime is common particularly in developing nations resulting in the dark figure of crime victim studies may be used to determine the frequency of crime in a given population the gap to official statistics is generally smaller with higher severity of the crime clearance rate measures the fraction of crimes where a criminal charge has been laid or the responsible person convicted fear of crime can be distinct from crime probability public perception crime is often a high priority political issue in developed countries regardless of the country s crime rates people that are not regularly exposed to crime most often experience it through media including news reporting and crime fiction exposure of crime through news stories is associated with alarmism and inaccurate perceptions of crime trends selection bias in new stories about criminals significantly over represent the prevalence of violent crime and news reporting will often overemphasize a specific type of crime for a period of time creating a crime wave effect as public opinion of morality changes over time actions that were once condemned as crimes may be considered justifiable criminal justice natural law theory justifying the state s use of force to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem one of the earliest justifications involved the theory of natural law this posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of morality or constructs them thomas aquinas wrote in the 13th century the rule and measure of human acts is the reason which is the first principle of human acts he regarded people as by nature rational beings concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature thus to be valid any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable in the 1760s william blackstone described the thesis this law of nature being co eval with mankind and dictated by god himself is of course superior in obligation to any other it is binding over all the globe in all countries and at all times no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority mediately or immediately from this original but john austin 1790 1859 an early positivist applied utilitarianism in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality he denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality thus in austinian terms a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility but every individual remains free to choose what to do similarly h l a hart saw the law as an aspect of sovereignty with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law involved internal logic and consistency and that the state s agents used state power with responsibility ronald dworkin rejects hart s theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right he offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of deference the citizen s duty to obey the law and a theory of enforcement which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law and a theory of legislative justice which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make there are natural law theorists who have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law this view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity all valid law must by definition count as morally just thus on this line of reasoning the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice corrections and punishment authorities may respond to crime through corrections carrying out punishment as a means to censure the criminal act punishment is generally reserved for serious offenses individuals regularly engage in activity that could be scrutinized under criminal law but are deemed inconsequential retributive justice seeks to create a system of accountability and punish criminals in a way that knowingly causes suffering this may arise out of a feeling that criminals deserve to suffer and that punishment should exist for its own sake the existence of punishment also creates an effect of deterrence that discourages criminal action for fear of punishment rehabilitation seeks to understand and mitigate the causes of a criminal s unlawful action to prevent recidivism different criminological theories propose different methods of rehabilitation including strengthening social networks reducing poverty influencing values and providing therapy for physical and mental ailments rehabilitative programs may include counseling or vocational education developed nations are less likely to use physical punishments instead they will impose financial penalties or imprisonment in places with widespread corruption or limited rule of law crime may be punished extralegally through mob rule and lynching whether a crime can be resolved through financial compensation varies depending on the culture and the specific context of the crime historically many societies have absolved acts of homicide through compensation to the victim s relatives criminology the study of crime is called criminology criminology is a subfield of sociology that addresses issues of social norms social order deviance and violence it includes the motivations and consequences of crime and its perpetrators as well as preventative measures either studying criminal acts on an individual level or the relationship of crime and the community due to the wide range of concepts associated with crime and the disagreement on a precise definition the focus of criminology can vary considerably various theories within criminology provide different descriptions and explanations for crime including social control theory subcultural theory strain theory differential association and labeling theory subfields of criminology and related fields of study include crime prevention criminal law crime statistics anthropological criminology criminal psychology criminal sociology criminal psychiatry victimology penology and forensic science besides sociology criminology is often associated with law and psychology causes and correlates criminal behavior determinants include cost benefit analysis opportunity or crime of passion a person that commits a criminal act typically believes that its benefits will outweigh the risk of being caught and punished negative economic factors such as unemployment and income inequality can increase the incentive to commit crime while severe punishments can deter crime in some cases social factors similarly affect the likelihood of criminal activity crime corresponds heavily with social integration groups that are less integrated with society or that are forcibly integrated with society are more likely to engage in crime involvement in the community such as through a church decreases the likelihood of crime while associating with criminals increases the likelihood of becoming a criminal as well there is no known genetic cause of crime some genes have been found to affect traits that may incline individuals toward criminal activity but no biological or physiological trait has been found to directly cause or compel criminal actions one biological factor is the disparity between men and women as men are significantly more likely to commit crimes than women in virtually all cultures crimes committed by men also tend to be more severe than those committed by women crime distribution shows a long tail with a small fraction of individuals re offending many times due to high recidivism while onset of crime at younger age predicts a longer criminal career see also crime displacement law and order politics rule of law organized crime notes references ashworth andrew

links", "Violence": "violence is often defined as the use of physical force or power by humans to cause harm and degradation to other living beings such as humiliation pain injury disablement damage to property and ultimately death as well as destruction to a society s living environment the world health organization who defines violence as the intentional use of physical force or power threatened or actual against oneself another person or against a group or community which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury death psychological harm maldevelopment or deprivation 5 there is growing recognition among researchers and practitioners of the need to include violence that does not necessarily result in injury or death 5 violence in many forms can be preventable there is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as concentrated regional poverty income and gender inequality the harmful use of alcohol and the absence of safe stable and nurturing relationships between children and parents strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence although mental and physical health and individual responses personalities etc have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors types the world health organization who divides violence into three broad categories self directed violence interpersonal violence collective violence this initial categorization differentiates between violence that a person inflicts upon themself violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states organized political groups militia groups and terrorist organizations alternatively violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive hostile self directed self directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and self abuse the former includes suicidal thoughts attempted suicides also called para suicide or deliberate self injury in some countries and suicide itself self abuse in contrast includes acts such as self mutilation collective collective violence is the instrumental use of violence by people who identify themselves as members of a group whether this group is transitory or has a more permanent identity against another group or set of individuals in order to achieve political economic or social objectives 82 unlike the other two broad categories the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes for example crimes of hate committed by organized groups terrorist acts and mob violence political violence includes war and related violent conflicts state violence and similar acts carried out by armed groups there may be multiple determinants of violence against civilians in such situations economic violence includes attacks motivated by economic gain such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity denying access to essential services or creating economic division and fragmentation clearly acts committed by domestic and subnational groups can have multiple motives slow violence is a long duration form of violence which is often invisible at least to those not impacted by it such as environmental degradation pollution and climate change warfare war is a state of prolonged violent large scale conflict involving two or more groups of people usually under the auspices of government it is the most extreme form of collective violence war is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts as war of aggression to conquer territory or loot resources in national self defence or liberation or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to secede from it there are also ideological religious and revolutionary wars since the industrial revolution the lethality of modern warfare has grown world war i casualties were over 40 million and world war ii casualties were over 70 million interpersonal interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories family and intimate partner violence that is violence largely between family members and intimate partners usually though not exclusively taking place in the home community violence violence between individuals who are unrelated and who may or may not know each other generally taking place outside the home the former group includes forms of violence such as child abuse and child corporal punishment intimate partner violence and abuse of the elderly the latter includes youth violence random acts of violence rape or sexual assault by strangers and violence in institutional settings such as schools workplaces prisons and nursing homes when interpersonal violence occurs in families its psychological consequences can affect parents children and their relationship in the short and long terms violence against children violence against children includes all forms of violence against people under 18 years old whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers peers romantic partners or strangers exposure to any form of trauma particularly in childhood can increase the risk of mental illness and suicide smoking alcohol and substance abuse chronic diseases like heart disease diabetes and cancer and social problems such as poverty crime and violence globally it is estimated that up to 1 billion children aged 2 17 years have experienced physical sexual or emotional violence or neglect in the past year most violence against children involves at least one of six main types of interpersonal violence that tend to occur at different stages in a child s development maltreatment maltreatment including violent punishment involves physical sexual and psychological emotional violence and neglect of infants children and adolescents by parents caregivers and other authority figures most often in the home but also in settings such as schools and orphanages it includes all types of physical and or emotional ill treatment sexual abuse neglect negligence and commercial or other child exploitation which results in actual or potential harm to the child s health survival development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility trust or power exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences it is complex and difficult to study there are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment data for many countries especially low and middle income countries are lacking current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used approximately 20 of women and 5 10 of men report being sexually abused as children while 25 50 of all children report being physically abused consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health and social and occupational functioning e g school job and relationship difficulties these can ultimately slow a country s economic and social development preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach effective prevention programmes support parents and teach positive parenting skills ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences bullying bullying including cyber bullying is unwanted aggressive behaviour by another child or group of children who are neither siblings nor in a romantic relationship with the victim it involves repeated physical psychological or social harm and often takes place in schools and other settings where children gather and online youth violence following the world health organization youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths and includes acts that range from bullying and physical fighting through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide worldwide some 250 000 homicides occur among youth 10 29 years of age each year which is 41 of the total number of homicides globally each year global burden of disease world health organization 2008 for each young person killed 20 40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment youth violence has a serious often lifelong impact on a person s psychological and social functioning youth violence greatly increases the costs of health welfare and criminal justice services reduces productivity decreases the value of property and generally undermines the fabric of society prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger resolve conflict and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems schools based anti bullying prevention programmes and programmes to reduce access to alcohol illegal drugs and guns also given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results similarly urban renewal projects such as business improvement districts have shown a reduction in youth violence different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical emotional and sexual abuse e g physical attacks bullying rape and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies according to researchers in 2018 more than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence the violence can also all take place under one roof or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it youth violence impacts individuals their families and society victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits the cost of which quickly add up since the victims of youth on youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and or mental injuries it is often up to their family members to take care of them including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence this causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child s brain trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety rage and the ability to concentrate they can also have problems remembering trusting and forming relationships since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional social and cognitive problems they may have trouble controlling emotions paying attention in school withdraw from friends or show signs of post traumatic stress disorder it is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short and long term negative effects e g poor concentration feelings of depression heightened levels of anxiety by taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they ve experienced negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated as an initial step the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings perceptions and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions using these techniques will teach body awareness reduce anxiety and nervousness and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people this is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance in addition to counseling therapy sessions and programs it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session many children have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence this includes organizations such as becoming a man ceasefire illinois chicago area project little black pearl and rainbow house these programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go stop the violence from occurring offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence if the youth do not have a safe place to go after school hours they will likely get into trouble receive poor grades drop out of school and use drugs and alcohol the gangs look for youth who do not have positive influences in their life and need protection this is why these programs are so important for the youth to have a safe environment rather than resorting to the streets intimate partner violence intimate partner violence or domestic violence involves physical sexual and emotional violence by an intimate partner or ex partner although males can also be victims intimate partner violence disproportionately affects females it commonly occurs against girls within child marriages and early forced marriages among romantically involved but unmarried adolescents it is sometimes called dating violence sexual violence sexual violence includes non consensual completed or attempted sexual contact and acts of a sexual nature not involving contact such as voyeurism or sexual harassment acts of sexual trafficking committed against someone who is unable to consent or refuse and online exploitation emotional or psychological violence emotional or psychological violence includes restricting a child s movements denigration ridicule threats and intimidation discrimination rejection and other non physical forms of hostile treatment intimate partner population level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non conflict settings a study conducted by who in 10 mainly developing countries found that among women aged 15 to 49 years between 15 japan and 70 ethiopia and peru of women reported physical and or sexual violence by an intimate partner a growing body of research on men and intimate partner violence focuses on men as both perpetrators and victims of violence as well as on how to involve men and boys in anti violence work intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short and long term physical mental sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children and lead to high social and economic costs these include both fatal and non fatal injuries depression and post traumatic stress disorder unintended pregnancies sexually transmitted infections including hiv factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education history of violence as a perpetrator a victim or a witness of parental violence harmful use of alcohol attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners and antisocial personality disorder a recent theory named the criminal spin suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence a violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence but in intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship the primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies those that combine microfinance with gender equality training promote communication and relationship skills within communities reduce access to and the harmful use of alcohol and change cultural gender norms sexual sexual violence is any sexual act attempt to obtain a sexual act unwanted sexual comments or advances or acts to traffic or otherwise directed against a person s sexuality using coercion by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim in any setting it includes rape defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis other body part or object population level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0 3 and 11 5 of women reported experiencing sexual violence sexual violence has serious short and long term consequences on physical mental sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence if perpetrated during childhood sexual violence can lead to increased smoking drug and alcohol misuse and risky sexual behaviors in later life it is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for domestic violence risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective school based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising but require further research to achieve lasting change it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women address discrimination against women and promote gender equality and help to move the culture away from violence elder maltreatment elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person while there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations especially in developing countries it is estimated that 4 6 of elderly people in high income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home however older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family friends or to the authorities data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals nursing homes and other long term care facilities are scarce elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long term psychological consequences elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns screening of potential victims and abusers caregiver support interventions e g stress management respite care adult protective services and self help groups their effectiveness has however not so far been well established targeted several rare but painful episodes of assassination attempted assassination and school shootings at elementary middle high schools as well as colleges and universities in the united states led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks these studies 1995 2002 investigated what the authors called targeted violence described the path to violence of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators a major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just come out of the blue everyday as an anthropological concept everyday violence may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence mainly political violence into daily practices latin america and the caribbean the region with the highest murder rate in the world experienced more than 2 5 million murders between 2000 and 2017 prevalence injuries and violence are a significant cause of death and burden of disease in all countries however they are not evenly distributed across or within countries violence related injuries kill 1 25 million people every year as of 2024 this is relatively similar to 2014 1 3 million people or 2 5 of global mortality 2013 1 28 million people and 1990 1 13 million people 2 for people aged 15 44 years violence is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide as of 2014 2 between 1990 and 2013 age standardised death rates fell for self harm and interpersonal violence 139 of the deaths in 2013 roughly 842 000 were attributed to suicide 405 000 to interpersonal violence and 31 000 to collective violence and legal intervention for each single death due to violence there are dozens of hospitalizations hundreds of emergency department visits and thousands of doctors appointments furthermore violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development it s particularly the case if it happened in childhood in 2013 of the estimated 405 000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally assault by firearm was the cause in 180 000 deaths assault by sharp object was the cause in 114 000 deaths and the remaining 110 000 deaths from other causes philosophical perspectives some philosophers have argued that any interpretation of reality is intrinsically violent slavoj \u017ei\u017eek in his book violence stated that something violent is the very symbolization of a thing an ontological perspective considers the harm inflicted by the very interpretation of the world as a form of violence that is distinct from physical violence in that it is possible to avoid physical violence whereas some ontological violence is intrinsic to all knowledge both foucault and arendt considered the relationship between power and violence but concluded that while related they are distinct 46 in feminist philosophy epistemic violence is the act of causing harm by an inability to understand the conversation of others due to ignorance some philosophers think this will harm marginalized groups brad evans states that violence represents a violation in the very conditions constituting what it means to be human as such is always an attack upon a person s dignity their sense of selfhood and their future and is both an ontological crime and a form of political ruination in a more general sense robert l holmes argues that while specific definitions of violence per se may continue to elude mankind it is nonetheless apparent that any appeal to its use is morally wrong on purely rational grounds in so far as it is presumptively wrong to do violence to innocent persons he further argues that at least one necessary condition for the formulation of any potential moral alternative to violence in all its manifistations is the exploration of a philosophy of nonviolence which places a concern for the lives and the well being of individual persons at its moral center factors and models of understanding violence cannot be attributed to solely protective factors or risk factors both of these factor groups are equally important in the prevention intervention and treatment of violence as a whole the cdc outlines several risk and protective factors for youth violence at the individual family social and community levels individual risk factors include poor behavioral control high emotional stress low iq and antisocial beliefs or attitudes family risk factors include authoritarian childrearing attitudes inconsistent disciplinary practices low emotional attachment to parents or caregivers and low parental income and involvement social risk factors include social rejection poor academic performance and commitment to school and gang involvement or association with delinquent peers community risk factors include poverty low community participation and diminished economic opportunities on the other hand individual protective factors include an intolerance towards deviance higher iq and gpa elevated popularity and social skills as well as religious beliefs family protective factors include a connectedness and ability to discuss issues with family members or adults parent family use of constructive coping strategies and consistent parental presence during at least one of the following when awakening when arriving home from school at dinner time or when going to bed social protective factors include quality school relationships close relationships with non deviant peers involvement in prosocial activities and exposure to school climates that are well supervised use clear behavior rules and disciplinary approaches and engage parents with teachers with many conceptual factors that occur at varying levels in the lives of those impacted the exact causes of violence are complex to represent this complexity the ecological or social ecological model is often used the following four level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence the first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence demographic characteristics age education income genetics brain lesions personality disorders substance abuse and a history of experiencing witnessing or engaging in violent behaviour the second level focuses on close relationships such as those with family and friends in youth violence for example having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person s risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence for intimate partner violence a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship in elder abuse important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver the third level explores the community context i e schools workplaces and neighbourhoods risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade the absence of social networks and concentrated poverty all these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence finally the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited the responsiveness of the criminal justice system social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent child relationships income inequality the strength of the social welfare system the social acceptability of violence the availability of weapons the exposure to violence in mass media and political instability child rearing while studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors cross cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of corporal punishment of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies for instance a 2005 analysis of 186 pre industrial societies found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide assault and war in the united states domestic corporal punishment has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses the american family violence researcher murray a straus believes that disciplinary spanking forms the most prevalent and important form of violence in american families whose effects contribute to several major societal problems including later domestic violence and crime psychology the causes of violent behavior in people are often a topic of research in psychology neurobiologist jan vodka emphasizes that for those purposes violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person based on the idea of human nature scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans among prehistoric humans there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as violent for example in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as violent though we may talk in a more metaphorical way of the state acting violently likewise understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor victim relationship hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression the concept of violence normalization is known as socially sanctioned or structural violence and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior it has been discussed at length by researchers in sociology medical anthropology psychology psychiatry philosophy and bioarchaeology evolutionary psychology offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts such as sexual jealousy in humans child abuse and homicide goetz 2010 argues that humans are similar to most mammal species and use violence in specific situations he writes that buss and shackelford 1997a proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression co opting the resources of others defending against attack inflicting costs on same sex rivals negotiating status and hierarchies deterring rivals from future aggression deterring mate from infidelity and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children goetz writes that most homicides seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death he argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status if there is a great initial status difference then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual at the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status media research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community and was rejected by the us supreme court in the brown v ema case as well as in a review of video game violence by the australian government 2010 which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data mental disorders prevention the threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began it is used in various degrees in most countries public awareness campaigns cities and counties throughout the united states organize violence prevention months where the mayor by proclamation or the county by a resolution encourage the private community and public sectors to engage in activities that raise awareness that violence is not acceptable through art music lectures and events for example violence prevention month coordinator karen earle lile in contra costa county california created a wall of life where children drew pictures that were put up in the walls of banks and public spaces displaying a child s view of violence they had witnessed and how it affected them in an effort to draw attention to how violence affects the community not just the people involved interpersonal violence a review of scientific literature by the world health organization on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness these strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model child caregiver relationships among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the nurse family partnership home visiting programme and the triple p parenting program there is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self directed violence in later life life skills in youth evidence shows that the life skills acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence improve social skills boost educational achievement and improve job prospects life skills refer to social emotional and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life gender equality evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent violence against women by promoting gender equality for instance evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence school based programmes such as safe dates programme in the united states of america and the youth relationship project in canada have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence cultural norms rules or expectations of behaviour norms within a cultural or social group can encourage violence interventions that challenge cultural and social norms supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak the effectiveness of interventions addressing dating violence and sexual abuse among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence support programmes interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services psychosocial interventions such as trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy to reduce mental health problems associated with violence including post traumatic stress disorder and protection orders which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence collective violence not surprisingly scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking however policies that facilitate reductions in poverty that make decision making more accountable that reduce inequalities between groups as well as policies that reduce access to biological chemical nuclear and other weapons have been recommended when planning responses to violent conflicts recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are co ordination of activities between various players and working towards global national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency criminal justice one of the main functions of law is to regulate violence sociologist max weber stated that the state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force to cause harm practised within the confines of a specific territory law enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society governments regulate the use of violence through legal systems governing individuals and political authorities including the police and military civil societies authorize some amount of violence exercised through the police power to maintain the status quo and enforce laws however german political theorist hannah arendt noted violence can be justifiable but it never will be legitimate its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future no one questions the use of violence in self defence because the danger is not only clear but also present and the end justifying the means is immediate arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites in the 20th century in acts of democide governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through police brutality execution massacre slave labour camps and sometimes through intentional famine violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in self defense are usually classified as crimes although not all crimes are violent crimes the federal bureau of investigation fbi classifies violence resulting in homicide into criminal homicide and justifiable homicide e g self defense the criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that justice is done the notions of individual blame responsibility guilt and culpability are central to criminal justice s approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system s main tasks is to do justice i e to ensure that offenders are properly identified that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible and that they are punished appropriately to prevent and respond to violence the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators the criminal justice approach beyond justice and punishment has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions aimed at those who have already been involved in violence either as victims or as perpetrators one of the main reasons offenders are arrested prosecuted and convicted is to prevent further crimes through deterrence threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes incapacitation physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up and through rehabilitation using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one s psychological make up to reduce the likelihood of future offences in recent decades in many countries in the world the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs for instance much of community and problem oriented policing aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it and not to increase the number of arrests indeed some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency juvenile justice systems an important component of criminal justice systems are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention in the us the criminal justice system has for instance funded school and community based initiatives to reduce children s access to guns and teach conflict resolution despite this force is used routinely against juveniles by police in 1974 the us department of justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention which has supported the blueprints for violence prevention programme at the university of colorado boulder public health the public health approach is a science driven population based interdisciplinary intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention rather than focusing on individuals the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people and to extend better care and safety to entire populations the public health approach is interdisciplinary drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine epidemiology sociology psychology criminology education and economics because all forms of violence are multi faceted problems the public health approach emphasizes a multi sectoral response it has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health education social welfare and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely criminal or medical problems the public health approach considers that violence rather than being the result of any single factor is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy individual close relationship family community and wider society of the social ecological model from a public health perspective prevention strategies can be classified into three types primary prevention approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs secondary prevention approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence such as pre hospital care emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape tertiary prevention approaches that focus on long term care in the wake of violence such as rehabilitation and reintegration and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long term disability associated with violence a public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence i e stopping them from occurring in the first place until recently this approach has been relatively neglected in the field with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible symptoms this allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health the public health approach is an evidence based and systematic process involving the following four steps defining the problem conceptually and numerically using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence the characteristics of those most affected the geographical distribution of incidents and the consequences of exposure to such violence investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence risk and protective factors and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes approaches to prevent violence whether targeted at individuals or entire communities must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared this step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting in many countries violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health the public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences in 1949 gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases in 1962 gomez referring to the who definition of health stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to extending life or to a complete state of well being he defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers military personnel or politicians however it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level this is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences the global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid 1990s in 1996 the world health assembly adopted resolution wha49 25 which declared violence a leading worldwide public health problem and requested that the world health organization who initiate public health activities to 1 document and characterize the burden of violence 2 assess the effectiveness of programmes with particular attention to women and children and community based initiatives and 3 promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels the world health organization s initial response to this resolution was to create the department of violence and injury prevention and disability and to publish the world report on violence and health 2002 the case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments first the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many particularly in emergency departments to mobilize to address it the information resources and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work second the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population level interventions typical of the public health approach third the criminal justice approach the other main approach to addressing violence link to entry above has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment intimate partner violence and elder abuse which makes up the largest share of non fatal violence fourth evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence human rights the human rights approach is based on the obligations of states to respect protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent eradicate and punish violence it recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights the rights to life liberty autonomy and security of the person the rights to equality and non discrimination the rights to be free from torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment the right to privacy and the right to the highest attainable standard of health these human rights are enshrined in international and regional treaties and national constitutions and laws which stipulate the obligations of states and include mechanisms to hold states accountable the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women for example requires that countries party to the convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women the convention on the rights of the child in its article 19 states that states parties shall take all appropriate legislative administrative social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence injury or abuse neglect or negligent treatment maltreatment or exploitation including sexual abuse while in the care of parent s legal guardian s or any other person who has the care of the child geographical context violence as defined in the dictionary of human geography appears whenever power is in jeopardy and in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose it is part of a larger matrix of socio political power struggles violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories direct violence structural violence and cultural violence thus defined and delineated it is of note as hyndman says that geography came late to theorizing violence in comparison to other social sciences social and human geography rooted in the humanist marxist and feminist subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn have long been concerned with social and spatial justice along with critical geographers and political geographers it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence keeping this idea of social spatial justice via geography in mind it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics derek gregory and alan pred assembled the influential edited collection violent geographies fear terror and political violence which demonstrates how place space and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present evidently political violence often gives a part for the state to play when modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence philosopher giorgio agamben s concepts of state of exception and homo sacer are useful to consider within a geography of violence the state in the grip of a perceived potential crisis whether legitimate or not takes preventative legal measures such as a suspension of rights it is in this climate as agamben demonstrates that the formation of the social democratic and nazi government s lager or concentration camp can occur however when this in limbo reality is designed to be in place until further notice the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself for agamben the physical space of the camp is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order but it is nevertheless not simply an external space at the scale of the body in the state of exception a person is so removed from their rights by juridical procedures and deployments of power that no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime in other words people become only homo sacer guantanamo bay could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer in the 1970s genocides in cambodia under the khmer rouge and pol pot resulted in the deaths of over two million cambodians which was 25 of the cambodian population forming one of the many contemporary examples of state sponsored violence about fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at choeung ek which is the best known of the extermination camps referred to as the killing fields the killings were arbitrary for example a person could be killed for wearing glasses since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy people were murdered with impunity because it was no crime cambodians were made homo sacer in a condition of bare life the killing fields manifestations of agamben s concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law featured the state of exception as part of pol pot s ideological intent to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative he dismantled the country s existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area forced movement such as this forced movement applied by pol pot is a clear display of structural violence when symbols of cambodian society were equally disrupted social institutions of every kind were purged or torn down cultural violence defined as when any aspect of culture such as language religion ideology art or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence such as murder at the killing fields vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended however ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s continue to create a violent landscape in cambodia human geography though coming late to the theorizing table has tackled violence through many lenses including anarchist geography feminist geography marxist geography political geography and critical geography however adriana cavarero notes that as violence spreads and assumes unheard of forms it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language cavarero proposes that in facing such a truth it is prudent to reconsider violence as horrorism that is as though ideally all the victims instead of their killers ought to determine the name with geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science rather than creating them solely within the discipline it seems that the self reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current re imaging of violence exemplified by cavarero epidemiology as of 2010 all forms of violence resulted in about 1 34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990 suicide accounts for about 883 000 interpersonal violence for 456 000 and collective violence for 18 000 deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64 000 in 1990 by way of comparison the 1 5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis 1 34 million road traffic injuries 1 21 million and malaria 830 000 but slightly less than the number of people who die from hiv aids 1 77 million for every death due to violence there are numerous nonfatal injuries in 2008 over 16 million cases of non fatal violence related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention beyond deaths and injuries forms of violence such as child maltreatment intimate partner violence and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent self directed violence in the last 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60 worldwide suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15 44 years in some countries and the second leading cause of death in the 10 24 years age group these figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than suicide suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030 although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries in both developed and developing countries interpersonal violence rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region in recent years homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in sub saharan africa and latin america and the caribbean and lowest in east asia the western pacific and some countries in northern africa studies show a strong inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality poorer countries especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex gender differences are least marked for children for the 15 to 29 age group male rates were nearly six times those for female rates for the remaining age groups male rates were from two to four times those for females studies in a number of countries show that for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent approximately 20 of women and 5 10 of men report being sexually abused as children while 25 50 of all children report being physically abused a who multi country study found that between 15 and 71 of women reported experiencing physical and or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives collective violence wars grab headlines but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict for example between 1976 and 2008 african americans were victims of 329 825 homicides although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world the average person living in a conflict affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2 0 per 100 000 population between 2004 and 2007 this can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7 6 per 100 000 people this illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence certainly there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high in iraq for example the direct conflict death rate for 2004 07 was 65 per 100 000 people per year and in somalia 24 per 100 000 people this rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100 000 in iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100 000 in somalia in 2007 history scientific evidence for warfare has come from settled sedentary communities some studies argue humans have a predisposition for violence chimpanzees also great apes have been known to kill members of competing groups for resources like food a comparison across mammal species found that humans have a paleolithic adult homicide rate of about 2 this would be lower than some other animals but still high however this study took into account the infanticide rate by some other animals such as meerkats but not of humans where estimates of children killed by infanticide in the mesolithic and neolithic eras vary from 15 to 50 percent other evidence suggests that organized large scale militaristic or regular human on human violence was absent for the vast majority of the human timeline and is first documented to have started only relatively recently in the holocene an epoch that began about 11 700 years ago probably with the advent of higher population densities due to sedentism social anthropologist douglas p fry writes that scholars are divided on the origins of possible increase of violence in other words war like behavior there are basically two schools of thought on this issue one holds that warfare goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage the second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans here warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10 000 years jared diamond in his books guns germs and steel and the third chimpanzee posits that the rise of large scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city states for instance the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter gatherer societies allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers or weapons manufacturers in academia the idea of the peaceful pre history and non violent tribal societies gained popularity with the post colonial perspective the trend starting in archaeology and spreading to anthropology reached its height in the late half of the 20th century however some newer research in archaeology and bioarchaeology may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon according to the book the bioarchaeology of violence violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history lawrence h keeley at the university of illinois writes in war before civilization that 87 of tribal societies were at war more than once per year and that 65 of them were fighting continuously he writes that the attrition rate of numerous close quarter clashes which characterize endemic warfare produces casualty rates of up to 60 compared to 1 of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare primitive warfare of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition fry explores keeley s argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states and that many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years the relatively peaceful period since world war ii is known as the long peace the better angels of our nature steven pinker s 2011 book the better angels of our nature argued that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia he argues for a paleolithic homicide rate of 15 steven pinker argues that by every possible measure every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times a few centuries ago for example genocide was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it cannibalism and slavery have been greatly reduced in the last thousand years and capital punishment is now banned in many countries according to pinker rape murder warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century pinker s analyses have also been criticized concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining pinker s observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of norbert elias who attributes the decline to a civilizing process in which the state s monopolization of violence the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or figurations and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts according to a 2010 study non lethal violence such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past they suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence often looks at homicide rates of death due to warfare but ignore the less obvious forms of violence society and culture beyond deaths and injuries highly prevalent forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence have serious lifelong non injury health consequences victims may engage in high risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders cancers depression diabetes and hiv aids resulting in premature death the balances of prevention mitigation mediation and exacerbation are complex and vary with the underpinnings of violence economic effects in countries with high levels of violence economic growth can be slowed down personal and collective security eroded and social development impeded families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth for societies meeting the direct costs of health criminal justice and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending the much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development increase socioeconomic inequality and erode human and social capital additionally communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions one of the possible proves might be the study of baten and gust that used regicide as measurement unit to approximate the influence of interpersonal violence and depict the influence of high interpersonal violence on economic development and level of investments the results of the research prove the correlation of the human capital and the interpersonal violence in 2016 the institute for economics and peace released the economic value of peace archived 2017 11 15 at the wayback machine report which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be 13 6 trillion in purchasing power parity terms religion and politics religious and political ideologies have been the cause of interpersonal violence throughout history ideologues often falsely accuse others of violence such as the ancient blood libel against jews the medieval accusations of casting witchcraft spells against women and modern accusations of satanic ritual abuse against day care center owners and others both supporters and opponents of the 21st century war on terrorism regard it largely as an ideological and religious war in 2007 us politician john edwards said the war on terror was nothing more than a slogan and a bumper sticker in 1992 former research fellow with the us cato institute leon hadar considered that it wasn t in america s interest to launch a crusade for democracy neither is it in her interest to be perceived as the guarantor of the status quo and the major obstacle to reform vittorio bufacchi describes two different modern concepts of violence one the minimalist conception of violence as an intentional act of excessive or destructive force the other the comprehensive conception which includes violations of rights including a long list of human needs anti capitalists say that capitalism is violent that private property and profit survive only because police violence defends them and that capitalist economies need war to expand in this view capitalism results in a form of structural violence that stems from inequality environmental damage and the exploitation of women and people of colour frantz fanon critiqued the violence of colonialism and wrote about the counter violence of the colonized victims throughout history most religions and individuals like mahatma gandhi have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely nonviolent means gandhi himself once wrote a society organized and run on the basis of complete non violence would be the purest anarchy modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of voluntarism mutualism anarchism and libertarianism luther seminary old testament scholar terence e fretheim wrote about the old testament for many people only physical violence truly qualifies as violence but certainly violence is more than killing people unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly the effect of limitation to a killing fields perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence we must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive that which demeans damages or depersonalizes others in view of these considerations violence may be defined as follows any action verbal or nonverbal oral or written physical or psychical active or passive public or private individual or institutional societal human or divine in whatever degree of intensity that abuses violates injures or kills some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view against women and children especially just beneath the surface in many of our homes churches and communities is abuse enough to freeze the blood moreover many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because

unicef heat and violence", "War": "war is an armed conflict between the armed forces of states or between governmental forces and armed groups that are organized under a certain command structure and have the capacity to sustain military operations or between such organized groups it is generally characterized by widespread violence destruction and mortality using regular or irregular military forces warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war or of wars in general total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets and can result in massive civilian or other non combatant suffering and casualties etymology the english word war derives from the 11th century old english words wyrre and werre from old french werre guerre as in modern french in turn from the frankish werra ultimately deriving from the proto germanic werz\u014d mixture confusion the word is related to the old saxon werran old high german werran and the modern german verwirren meaning to confuse to perplex to bring into confusion history anthropologists disagree about whether warfare was common throughout human prehistory or whether it was a more recent development following the invention of agriculture or organised states it is difficult to determine whether warfare occurred during the paleolithic due to the sparseness of known remains some sources claim that most middle and upper paleolithic societies were possibly fundamentally egalitarian and may have rarely or never engaged in organized violence between groups i e war evidence of violent conflict appears to increase during the mesolithic period from around 10 000 years ago onwards raymond case kelly a cultural anthropologist and ethnologist from the us claimed that before 400 000 years ago groups of people clashed like groups of chimpanzees however later they preferred positive and peaceful social relations between neighboring groups such as joint hunting trading and courtship in his book warless societies and the origin of war he explores the origins of modern wars and states that high surplus product encourages conflict so raiding often begins in the richest environments in war before civilization lawrence h keeley a professor at the university of illinois says approximately 90 95 of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare and many fought constantly keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids large raids and massacres all of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies a finding supported by other researchers keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized as the participants did not have any formal training scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost effective way to protect the society against enemy raids william rubinstein wrote pre literate societies even those organized in a relatively advanced way were renowned for their studied cruelty since the rise of the state some 5 000 years ago military activity has continued over much of the globe in europe the oldest known battlefield is thought to date to 1250 bc the bronze age has been described as a key period in the intensification of warfare with the emergence of dedicated warriors and the development of metal weapons like swords two other commonly named periods of increase are the axial age and modern times the invention of gunpowder and its eventual use in warfare together with the acceleration of technological advances have fomented major changes to war itself in coercion capital and european states ad 990 1992 charles tilly professor of history sociology and social science at the university of michigan and the columbia university described as the founding father of 21st century sociology argued that war made the state and the state made war saying that wars have led to creation of states which in their turn perpetuate war tilly s theory of state formation is considered dominant in the state formation literature since 1945 great power wars interstate wars territorial conquests and war declarations have declined in frequency wars have been increasingly regulated by international humanitarian law battle deaths and casualties have declined in part due to advances in military medicine and despite advances in weapons in western europe since the late 18th century more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place but no battle has taken place since 1945 however war in some aspects has not necessarily declined civil wars have increased in absolute terms since 1945 a distinctive feature of war since 1945 is that combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies the number of civil wars declined since 1991 types of warfare asymmetric warfare is the methods used in conflicts between belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or size biological warfare or germ warfare is the use of biological infectious agents or toxins such as bacteria viruses and fungi against people plants or animals this can be conducted through sophisticated technologies like cluster munitions or with rudimentary techniques like catapulting an infected corpse behind enemy lines and can include weaponized or non weaponized pathogens chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during world war i and resulted in over a million estimated casualties including more than 100 000 civilians cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct military conflict but with a sustained threat of it including high levels of military preparations expenditures and development and may involve active conflicts by indirect means such as economic warfare political warfare covert operations espionage cyberwarfare or proxy wars conventional warfare is a form of warfare between states in which nuclear biological chemical or radiological weapons are not used or see limited deployment cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation s information systems insurgency is a rebellion against authority where irregular forces take up arms to change an existing political order an insurgency can be fought via counterinsurgency and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents claims against the incumbent regime information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems against the computers and networks that support the four critical infrastructures the power grid communications financial and transportation nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary or a major method of achieving capitulation radiological warfare is any form of warfare involving deliberate radiation poisoning or contamination of an area with radiological sources total war is warfare by any means possible disregarding the laws of war placing no limits on legitimate military targets using weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population unconventional warfare can be defined as military and quasi military operations other than conventional warfare and may use covert forces or actions such as subversion diversion sabotage espionage biowarfare sanctions propaganda or guerrilla warfare aims entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation propaganda tool war aims may stand as a proxy for national military resolve definition fried defines war aims as the desired territorial economic military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war classification tangible intangible aims tangible war aims may involve for example the acquisition of territory as in the german goal of lebensraum in the first half of the 20th century or the recognition of economic concessions as in the anglo dutch wars intangible war aims like the accumulation of credibility or reputation may have more tangible expression conquest restores prestige annexation increases power explicit implicit aims explicit war aims may involve published policy decisions implicit war aims can take the form of minutes of discussion memoranda and instructions positive negative aims positive war aims cover tangible outcomes negative war aims forestall or prevent undesired outcomes war aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into peace conditions the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war effects casualties estimates for total deaths due to war vary widely in one estimate primitive warfare from 50 000 to 3000 bce has been thought to have claimed 400 million 133 000 victims based on the assumption that it accounted for the 15 1 of all deaths ian morris estimated that the rate could be as high as 20 other scholars find the prehistoric percentage much lower around 2 similar to the neanderthals and ancestors of apes and primates for the period 3000 bce until 1991 estimates range from 151 million to several billion the lowest estimate for history of 151 million was calculated by william eckhardt he explained his method as summing the recorded casualties and multiplying their average by the number of recorded battles or wars this method excludes indirect deaths for premodern wars and all deaths for unrecorded wars few premodern wars were recorded beyond eurasia and only 18 wars were recorded for period 3000 1500 bc worldwide later researches shifted from eckhardt s approach to general estimations of the percentage of population killed by wars azar gat and ian morris both give the lowest estimate of 1 for history including all the 20th century or about 1 billion the highest estimates of both scholars exceed the famous hoax of 3 640 000 000 people killed in wars which circulated decades in scholarly literature in various countries gat gives 5 or about 5 billion morris gives for the 20th century 2 for 1400 1900 3 in europe and slightly higher elsewhere 5 for the ancient empires in 500 bc ad 200 10 for the rest of history and 20 for prehistory his total for history is thus about 9 billion largest wars by death toll the deadliest war in history in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start is world war ii from 1939 to 1945 with 70 85 million deaths followed by the mongol conquests at up to 60 million as concerns a belligerent s losses in proportion to its prewar population the most destructive war in modern history may have been the paraguayan war see paraguayan war casualties in 2013 war resulted in 31 000 deaths down from 72 000 deaths in 1990 war usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem a decrease in social spending famine large scale emigration from the war zone and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians for instance of the nine million people who were on the territory of the byelorussian ssr in 1941 some 1 6 million were killed by the germans in actions away from battlefields including about 700 000 prisoners of war 500 000 jews and 320 000 people counted as partisans the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers three of the ten most costly wars in terms of loss of life have been waged in the last century these are the two world wars followed by the second sino japanese war which is sometimes considered part of world war ii or as overlapping most of the others involved china or neighboring peoples the death toll of world war ii being over 60 million surpasses all other war death tolls on military personnel military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries including depression posttraumatic stress disorder disease injury and death in every war in which american soldiers have fought in the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire swank and marchand s world war ii study found that after sixty days of continuous combat 98 of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases confusional states conversion hysteria anxiety obsessional and compulsive states and character disorders one tenth of mobilised american men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945 and after thirty five days of uninterrupted combat 98 of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees additionally it has been estimated anywhere from 18 to 54 of vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder based on 1860 census figures 8 of all white american males aged 13 to 43 died in the american civil war including about 6 in the north and approximately 18 in the south the war remains the deadliest conflict in american history resulting in the deaths of 620 000 military personnel united states military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million of the 60 million european military personnel who were mobilized in world war i 8 million were killed 7 million were permanently disabled and 15 million were seriously injured during napoleon s retreat from moscow more french military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the russians of the 450 000 soldiers who crossed the neman on 25 june 1812 less than 40 000 returned more military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action in addition if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection for instance during the seven years war the royal navy reported it conscripted 184 899 sailors of whom 133 708 72 died of disease or were missing it is estimated that between 1985 and 1994 378 000 people per year died due to war on civilians most wars have resulted in significant loss of life along with destruction of infrastructure and resources which may lead to famine disease and death in the civilian population during the thirty years war in europe the population of the holy roman empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war war also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes a medium sized conflict with about 2 500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10 and malnutrition by 3 3 additionally about 1 8 of the population loses access to drinking water most estimates of world war ii casualties indicate around 60 million people died 40 million of whom were civilians deaths in the soviet union were around 27 million since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children population growth in the postwar soviet union was much lower than it otherwise would have been economic once a war has ended losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations in certain cases land is ceded to the victorious nations for example the territory of alsace lorraine has been traded between france and germany on three different occasions typically war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons the common view among economic historians is that the great depression ended with the advent of world war ii many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the great depression though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery though it did help in reducing unemployment in most cases such as the wars of louis xiv the franco prussian war and world war i warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved for example russia s involvement in world war i took such a toll on the russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the russian revolution of 1917 world war ii world war ii was the most financially costly conflict in history its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion u s dollars on the war effort as adjusted to 1940 prices the great depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials by the end of the war 70 of european industrial infrastructure was destroyed property damage in the soviet union inflicted by the axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles the combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1 710 cities and towns 70 000 villages hamlets 2 508 church buildings 31 850 industrial establishments 40 000 mi 64 374 km of railroad 4100 railroad stations 40 000 hospitals 84 000 schools and 43 000 public libraries theories of motivation there are many theories about the motivations for war but no consensus about which are most common military theorist carl von clausewitz said every age has its own kind of war its own limiting conditions and its own peculiar preconceptions psychoanalytic dutch psychoanalyst joost meerloo held that war is often a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage where the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction other psychoanalysts such as e f m durban and john bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent this aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races religions nations or ideologies by this theory the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare the italian psychoanalyst franco fornari a follower of melanie klein thought war was the paranoid or projective elaboration of mourning fornari thought war and violence develop out of our love need our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached namely our early mother and our fusion with her for the adult nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country to give over their bodies to their nation despite fornari s theory that man s altruistic desire for self sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers one psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by maurice walsh he argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power war is caused by leaders who seek war such as napoleon and hitler such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader who then leads the nation to war naturally the common people don t want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country evolutionary several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare there are two main schools one sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies such as territoriality and sexual competition the latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees as well as in many ant species group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior some proponents of the idea argue that war while innate has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states psychologist and linguist steven pinker argued that war related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory he also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups as well as on an individual level it was important to have a reputation for retaliation causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group s or an individual s reputation honor crofoot and wrangham have argued that warfare if defined as group interactions in which coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups is a characteristic of most human societies those in which it has been lacking tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors ashley montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare thus he argues warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention associated with certain types of human societies montagu s argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent e g the chewong and semai of the malay peninsula bobbi s low has observed correlation between warfare and education noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive economic war can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system in this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth war has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state building and fiscal capacity while this theory has been applied to many conflicts such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide or when considering that it is relative not absolute wealth differences that may fuel wars there are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support fascists in particular by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force some centrist capitalist world leaders including presidents of the united states and u s generals expressed support for an economic view of war marxist the marxist theory of war is quasi economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great imperialist powers claiming these wars are a natural result of capitalism marxist economists karl kautsky rosa luxemburg rudolf hilferding and vladimir lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand producers must expand into non capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods hence driving imperialism demographic demographic theories can be grouped into two classes malthusian and youth bulge theories malthusian malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict pope urban ii in 1095 on the eve of the first crusade advocating crusade as a solution to european overpopulation said for this land which you now inhabit shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks is too narrow for your large population it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators hence it is that you murder and devour one another that you wage wars and that many among you perish in civil strife let hatred therefore depart from among you let your quarrels end enter upon the road to the holy sepulchre wrest that land from a wicked race and subject it to yourselves this is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the malthusian theory of war in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources thomas malthus 1766 1834 wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war disease or famine the violent herder farmer conflicts in nigeria mali sudan and other countries in the sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth youth bulge according to heinsohn who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the fighting age cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age it will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4 8 children per woman with a 15 29 year delay heinsohn saw both past christianist european colonialism and imperialism as well as today s islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern europe including the french revolution of 1789 and the effect of economic depression upon the largest german youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of nazism in germany in the 1930s the 1994 rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the world bank population action international and the berlin institute for population and development youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial gender and age discrimination cultural geoffrey parker argues that what distinguishes the western way of war based in western europe chiefly allows historians to explain its extraordinary success in conquering most of the world after 1500 the western way of war rests upon five principal foundations technology discipline a highly aggressive military tradition a remarkable capacity to innovate and to respond rapidly to the innovation of others and from about 1500 onward a unique system of war finance the combination of all five provided a formula for military success the outcome of wars has been determined less by technology then by better war plans the achievement of surprise greater economic strength and above all superior discipline parker argues that western armies were stronger because they emphasized discipline that is the ability of a formation to stand fast in the face of the enemy where they re attacking or being attacked without giving way to the natural impulse of fear and panic discipline came from drills and marching in formation target practice and creating small artificial kinship groups such as the company and the platoon to enhance psychological cohesion and combat efficiency rationalist rationalism is an international relations theory or framework rationalism and neorealism international relations operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational seek the best possible outcomes for themselves and desire to avoid the costs of war under one game theory approach rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain would be better off if war did not occur and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs under another rationalist game theory without bargaining the peace war game optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played in rationalist explanations for war james fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war issue indivisibilities incentives to misrepresent or information asymmetry commitment problems issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them but only owned entirely by one side or the other information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities and do not agree on either who would win a war between them or the magnitude of state s victory or loss for instance geoffrey blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength he cites historical examples of war and demonstrates war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power thirdly bargaining may fail due to the states inability to make credible commitments within the rationalist tradition some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias but are still as rational as you and me according to philosopher iain king most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success while most participants underrate their chances of injury king asserts that most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in groupthink which is faulty but still rational the rationalist theory focused around bargaining which is currently under debate the iraq war proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars political science the statistical analysis of war was pioneered by lewis fry richardson following world war i more recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the correlates of war project peter brecke and the uppsala conflict data program the following subsections consider causes of war from system societal and individual levels of analysis this kind of division was first proposed by kenneth waltz in man the state and war and has been often used by political scientists since then 143 system level there are several different international relations theory schools supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense which is called the security dilemma 145 within the realist school as represented by scholars such as henry kissinger and hans morgenthau and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as kenneth waltz and john mearsheimer two main sub theories are balance of power theory states have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon and war is the result of the would be hegemon s persistent attempts at power acquisition in this view an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable and movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing 147 however evidence has shown power polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars 147 48 power transition theory hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order but they eventually decline and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to pre emptively suppress them 148 on this view unlike for balance of power theory wars become more probable when power is more equally distributed this power preponderance hypothesis has empirical support 148 the two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance 148 liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations critics respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits especially historically if not as much today 149 furthermore trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict 150 empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed and moreover some evidence suggests countries at war do not necessarily trade less with each other 150 societal level diversionary theory also known as the scapegoat hypothesis suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support 152 this is supported by literature showing out group hostility enhances in group bonding and a significant domestic rally effect has been demonstrated when conflicts begin 152 13 however studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed 152 53 u s war time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent u s leaders have supported diversionary theory individual level these theories suggest differences in people s personalities decision making emotions belief systems and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand 157 for instance it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases 157 such as prospect theory ethics the morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years the two principal aspects of ethics in war according to the just war theory are jus ad bellum and jus in bello jus ad bellum right to war dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation there are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war first any just war must be declared by a lawful authority second it must be a just and righteous cause with sufficient gravity to merit large scale violence third the just belligerent must have rightful intentions namely that they seek to advance good and curtail evil fourth a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success fifth the war must be a last resort and sixth the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used jus in bello right in war is the set of ethical rules when conducting war the two main principles are proportionality and discrimination proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered the principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war and specifically makes a separation between combatants who it is permissible to kill and non combatants who it is not failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent the just war theory was foundational in the creation of the united nations and in international law s regulations on legitimate war lewis coser an american conflict theorist and sociologist argued that conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created thus the struggle of opposing forces rather than being disruptive may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society limiting and stopping religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the second vatican council document gaudiem et spes any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against god and man himself it merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation anti war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century including most prominently world war i world war ii and the vietnam war in the 21st century worldwide anti war movements occurred in response to the united states invasion of afghanistan and iraq protests opposing the war in afghanistan occurred in europe asia and the united states pauses during a war the parties may agree to pauses a ceasefire is a stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions often due to mediation by a third party ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty but also as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces a ceasefire can be temporary with an intended end date or may be intended to last indefinitely a ceasefire is distinct from an armistice in that the armistice is a formal end to a war whereas a ceasefire may be a temporary stoppage the immediate goal of a ceasefire is to stop violence but the underlying purposes of ceasefires vary ceasefires may be intended to meet short term limited needs such as providing humanitarian aid manage a conflict to make it less devastating or advance efforts to peacefully resolve a dispute an actor may not always intend for a ceasefire to advance the peaceful resolution of a conflict but instead give the actor an upper hand in the conflict for example by re arming and repositioning forces or attacking an unsuspecting adversary which creates bargaining problems that may make ceasefires less likely to be implemented and less likely to be durable if implemented the durability of ceasefire agreements is affected by several factors such as demilitarized zones withdrawal of troops and third party guarantees and monitoring e g peacekeeping ceasefire agreements are more likely to be durable when they reduce incentives to attack reduce uncertainty about the adversary s intentions and

absence of hostility and violence in a societal sense peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict such as war and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups promotion of peace is a core tenet of many philosophies religions and ideologies many of which consider it a core tenet of their philosophy some examples are faiths such as buddhism and christianity important figures like gandhi and throughout literature like perpetual peace a philosophical sketch by immanuel kant the art of peace by morihei ueshiba or ideologies that strictly adhere to it such as pacifism within a sociopolitical scope it is a frequent subject of symbolism and features prominently in art and other cultural traditions the representation of peace has taken many shapes with a variety of symbols pertaining to it based on culture context and history each with their respective symbolism whose nature can be very complex an example being during post violence in contexts where intense emotions these symbols can form to evoke unity and cooperation described as to fill groups of people with pride and connection yet the symbolism could also possibly form to convey oppression hatred or else as such a universal definition for peace does not concretely exist but gets expanded and defined proactively based on context and culture in which it can serve many meanings not particularly benevolent in its symbolism psychological peace such as peaceful thinking and emotions is less relatively well defined yet perhaps a necessary precursor to establishing behavioural peace peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a peaceful inner disposition it has been argued by some that inner qualities such as tranquility patience respect compassion kindness self control courage moderation forgiveness equanimity and the ability to see the big picture can promote peace within an individual regardless of the external circumstances of their life etymology the term peace originates from the anglo french pes and the old french pais meaning peace reconciliation silence agreement 11th century the anglo french term pes itself comes from the latin pax meaning peace compact agreement treaty of peace tranquility absence of hostility harmony the english word came into use in various personal greetings from c 1300 as a translation of the hebrew word shalom which according to jewish theology comes from a hebrew verb meaning to be complete whole although peace is the usual translation it is an incomplete one because shalom which is also cognate with the arabic salaam has multiple other meanings in addition to peace including justice good health safety well being prosperity equity security good fortune and friendliness as well as simply the greetings hello and goodbye on a personal level peaceful behaviours are kind considerate respectful just and tolerant of others beliefs and behaviors tending to manifest goodwill this understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual s introspective sense or concept of her himself as in being at peace in one s own mind as found in european references from c 1200 the early english term is also used in the sense of quiet reflecting calm serene and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that have an absence of quarreling disturbances and agitation but seek clarity of conversation and tranquility in many languages the word peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell for example the hawaiian word aloha as well as the arabic word salaam in english the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell especially for the dead as in the phrases rest in peace or peace out history peace was forged through diplomacy in the form of royal marriages both in the distant past and in modern times two early examples of royal marriages being used to establish diplomatic relations are hermodike i who married the king of phrygia around 800 bce and hermodike ii who married the king of lydia around 600 bce both marriages involved greek princesses from the house of agamemnon and kings from what is now turkey the marriages between the greek princesses and the kings of phrygia and lydia had a significant impact on the region leading to the transfer of important technological innovations from anatolia to greece in particular the phrygians introduced the greek alphabet while the lydians pioneered the use of coinage as a form of currency both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation peace has not always been achieved through peaceful means in many cases it has been enforced by the victors of war often through the use of violence and coercion in his work agricola the roman historian tacitus writes passionately and critically about the greed and arrogance of the roman empire portraying it as a ruthless and self serving power one that tacitus says is by the caledonian chieftain calgacus ends with auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium atque ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant to ravage to slaughter to usurp under false titles they call empire and where they make a desert they call it peace oxford revised translation discussion of peace is therefore at the same time an inquiry into its form is it simply the absence of mass organized killing war or does peace require a particular morality and justice just peace societal peace can be seen at least in two forms a simple silence of arms absence of war absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations which are characterized by justice mutual respect respect for law and good will since 1945 the united nations and the united nations security council have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war nonetheless nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then organizations and prizes united nations the united nations un is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law international security economic development social progress human rights and achieving world peace the un was founded in 1945 after world war ii to replace the league of nations to stop wars between countries and to provide a platform for dialogue after authorization by the security council the un sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities since the un does not maintain its own military peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the un the forces also called the blue helmets who enforce un accords are awarded united nations medals which are considered international decorations instead of military decorations the peacekeeping force as a whole received the nobel peace prize in 1988 police the obligation of the state to provide for domestic peace within its borders is usually charged to the police and other general domestic policing activities the police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state to enforce the law to protect the lives liberty and possessions of citizens and to prevent crime and civil disorder their powers include the power of arrest and the legitimized use of force the term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors however gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing police forces are usually public sector services funded through taxes national security the national security apparatus of a nation is responsible for providing peace and security against foreign threats and aggression national security can be threatened by a range of factors including actions by other states such as military or cyber attacks violent non state actors such as terrorist attacks organized criminal groups such as narcotic cartels and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes v 1 8 systemic drivers of insecurity which may be transnational include economic inequality and marginalisation political exclusion climate change and nuclear proliferation in view of the wide range of risks the preservation of peace and the security of a nation state have several dimensions including economic security energy security physical security environmental security food security border security and cyber security these dimensions correlate closely with elements of national power league of nations the principal forerunner of the united nations was the league of nations it was created at the paris peace conference of 1919 and emerged from the advocacy of woodrow wilson and other idealists during world war i the covenant of the league of nations was included in the treaty of versailles in 1919 and the league was based in geneva until its dissolution as a result of world war ii and replacement by the united nations the high hopes widely held for the league in the 1920s for example amongst members of the league of nations union gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the league struggled to respond to challenges from nazi germany fascist italy and japan the prominent scholar sir alfred eckhard zimmern who is widely regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals of the league of nations drew inspiration for his studies from the classics along with other british scholars such as gilbert murray and florence stawell this group of scholars is often referred to as the greece and peace set due to their shared interest in ancient greek civilization and the promotion of peace the creation of the league of nations and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues expressed for example by the union for democratic control during world war i also saw the creation after world war i of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs such as the council on foreign relations in new york and the royal institute of international affairs at chatham house in london at the same time the academic study of international relations started to professionalise with the creation of the first professorship of international politics named for woodrow wilson at aberystwyth wales in 1919 olympic games the late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the nobel peace prize the rhodes scholarships the carnegie endowment for international peace and ultimately the league of nations also saw the re emergence of the ancient olympic ideal led by pierre de coubertin this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the modern olympic games nobel peace prize since 1901 the nobel peace prize has been the world s most prestigious honor given to individuals or organizations who have made significant contributions to peace the prize is awarded by the norwegian nobel committee a group of five individuals chosen by the norwegian parliament nominees for the prize come from around the world and are often those who have worked to end conflict protect human rights or promote humanitarian efforts it is awarded annually to internationally notable persons following the prize s creation in the will of alfred nobel according to nobel s will the peace prize shall be awarded to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses rhodes fulbright and schwarzman scholarships in creating the rhodes scholarships for outstanding students from the united states germany and much of the british empire cecil rhodes wrote in 1901 that the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie this peace purpose of the rhodes scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century and became prominent again in recent years under warden of the rhodes house donald markwell a historian of thought about the causes of war and peace this vision greatly influenced senator j william fulbright in the goal of the fulbright fellowships to promote international understanding and peace and has guided many other international fellowship programs including the schwarzman scholars to china created by stephen a schwarzman in 2013 gandhi peace prize the international gandhi peace prize named after mahatma gandhi is awarded annually by the government of india it was launched as a tribute to the ideals

and the international festival of peace poetry religious beliefs religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life including conflicts between among and within persons and societies in ancient greek speaking areas the virtue of peace was personified as the goddess eirene and in latin speaking areas as the goddess pax her image was typically represented by ancient sculptors as a full grown woman usually with a horn of plenty and scepter and sometimes with a torch or olive leaves christianity christians who believe jesus of nazareth to be the jewish messiah called christ meaning anointed one interpret isaiah 9 6 as a messianic prophecy of jesus in which he is called the prince of peace in the gospel of luke zechariah celebrates his son john and

churches in the anabaptist christian tradition such as the mennonites and quakers as well holiness methodist pacifists such as the immanuel missionary church practice nonresistance and do not participate in warfare in the catholic church numerous pontifical documents on the holy rosary document a continuity of views of the popes to have confidence in the holy rosary as a means to foster peace in the encyclical mense maio 1965 in which he urged the practice of the holy rosary and as reaffirmed in the encyclical christi matri 1966 to implore peace pope paul vi stated in the apostolic

chariot that leads to victory is of another kind valour and fortitude are its wheels truthfulness and virtuous conduct are its banner strength discretion self restraint and benevolence are its four horses harnessed with the cords of forgiveness compassion and equanimity whoever has this righteous chariot has no enemy to conquer anywhere buddhism buddhists believe that peace is attained by ending pain and suffering they regard pain and suffering is stemming from cravings in the extreme greed aversions fears and delusions and suffering is attachments to outcomes to eliminate such pain and suffering and achieve personal peace followers in the path of the buddha adhere to a set of teachings called the four noble truths a central tenet in buddhist philosophy islam islam derived from the root word salam which literally means peace quran states those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of allah surely in the remembrance of allah do hearts find comfort and stated o believers when you are told to make room in gatherings then do so allah will make room for you in his grace and if you are told to rise then do so allah will elevate those of you who are faithful and raise those gifted with knowledge in rank and allah is all aware of what you do judaism the judaic tradition associates god with peace as evidenced by various principles and laws in judaism shalom the biblical and modern hebrew word for peace is one of the names for god according to the judaic law and tradition for instance in traditional jewish law individuals are prohibited from saying shalom when they are in the bathroom as there is a prohibition on uttering any of god s names in the bathroom out of respect for the divine name jewish liturgy and prayer is replete with prayers asking god to establish peace in the world the \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 a key prayer in judaism that is recited three times each day concludes with a blessing for peace the last blessing of the \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 also known as the amida standing as the prayer is said while standing is focused on peace beginning and ending with supplications for peace and blessings peace is central to judaism s core principle of \u05de \u05e9 \u05d9\u05d7 messiah which connotes a time of universal peace and abundance a time where weapons will be turned into plowshares and lions will sleep with lambs as it is written in the book of isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare the wolf will live with the lamb the leopard will lie down with the goat the calf and the lion and the yearling together and a little child will lead them the cow will feed with the bear their young will lie down together and the lion will eat straw like the ox the infant will play near the hole of the cobra and the young child put his hand into the viper s nest they will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea this last metaphor from tanakh hebrew bible symbolizes the peace by which a longed for messianic age will be characterized a peace in which natural enemies the strong and the weak predator and prey will live in harmony jews pray for the messianic age of peace every day in the \u05de \u05e9 \u05d9\u05d7 in addition to faith in the coming of the messianic age constituting one of the thirteen core principles of faith in judaism according to maimonides ideological beliefs pacifism pacifism is the categorical opposition to the behaviors of war or violence as a means of settling disputes or of gaining advantage pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors such as the military or arms manufacturers to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force groups that sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include anarchists and libertarians absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance including defense of self and others pacifism may be based on moral principles a deontological view or pragmatism a consequentialist view principled pacifism holds that all forms of violent behavior are inappropriate responses to conflict and are morally wrong pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found inner peace meditation and prayerfulness psychological or inner peace i e peace of mind refers to a state of being internally or spiritually at peace with sufficient clarity of knowledge and understanding to remain calm in the face of apparent discord stress and discomfort being internally at peace is considered to be a healthy playable mental state a homeostasis of emotions and to be the opposite of feeling stressful mentally anxious or emotionally unstable within meditative traditions the achievement of peace of mind is often associated with bliss and happiness peace of mind serenity and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress in some meditative traditions inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation prayer tai chi yoga or other various types of mental or physical disciplines many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself an emphasis on finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as buddhism hinduism and some traditional christian contemplative practices such as monasticism as well as with the new age movement non aggression principle the non aggression principle asserts that aggression against an individual or an individual s property is always an immoral violation of life liberty and property rights utilizing deceit instead of consent to achieve ends is also a violation of the non aggression principle therefore under the framework of this principle rape murder deception involuntary taxation government regulation and other behaviors that initiate aggression against otherwise peaceful individuals are considered violations this principle is most commonly adhered to by libertarians a common elevator pitch for this principle is good ideas don t require force satyagraha satyagraha is a philosophy and practice of nonviolent resistance developed by mohandas karamchand gandhi he deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for indian independence and also during his earlier struggles in south africa the word satyagraha itself was coined through a public contest that gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in south africa indian opinion when he realized that neither the common contemporary hindu language nor the english language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict according to gandhi s autobiography the contest winner was maganlal gandhi presumably no relation who submitted the entry sadagraha which gandhi then modified to satyagraha etymologically this hindic word means truth firmness and is commonly translated as steadfastness in the truth or truth force satyagraha theory also influenced martin luther king jr james bevel and others during the campaigns they led during the civil rights movement in the united states the theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable therefore it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace as gandhi wrote they say means are after all means i would say means are after all everything as the means so the end a quote sometimes attributed to gandhi but also to a j muste sums it up there is no way to peace peace is the way monuments the following are monuments to peace theories many different theories of peace exist in the world of peace studies which involves the study of de escalation conflict transformation disarmament and cessation of violence the definition of peace can vary with religion culture or subject of study balance of power the classical realist position is that the key to promoting order between states and so of increasing the chances of peace is the maintenance of a balance of power between states a situation where no state is so dominant that it can lay down the law to the rest exponents of this view have included metternich bismarck hans morgenthau and henry kissinger a related approach more in the tradition of hugo grotius than thomas hobbes was articulated by the so called english school of international relations theory such as martin wight in his book power politics 1946 1978 and hedley bull in the anarchical society 1977 as the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace this was a radical critique of those supporters of the allied and associated powers who justified entry into world war i on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in europe from a german bid for hegemony in the second half of the 20th century and especially during the cold war a particular form of balance of power mutual nuclear deterrence emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace and that the nuclear umbrella made it safe for smaller wars e g the vietnam war and the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia to end the prague spring so making such wars more likely appeasement and deterrence appeasement is a strategy to achieve peace by making political material or territorial concessions to an aggressive power deterrence is a strategy to achieve peace by using threats or limited force to dissuade an actor from escalating conflict typically because the prospective attacker believes that the probability of success is low and the costs of attack are high speaking truth to power speaking truth to power is a non violent political tactic employed by dissidents against the received wisdom or propaganda of governments they regard as oppressive authoritarian or an ideocracy practitioners who have campaigned for a more just and truthful world have included apollonius of tyana vaclav havel nelson mandela archbishop desmond tutu mahatma gandhi bacha khan and the dalai lama the phrase originated with a pamphlet speak truth to power a quaker search for an alternative to violence published by the american friends service committee in 1955 a contributor of the pamphlet s contents was civil rights activist bayard rustin free trade and interdependence it was a central tenet of classical liberalism for example among english liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century that free trade promoted peace for example the cambridge economist john maynard keynes 1883 1946 said that he was brought up on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s during the economic globalization in the decades leading up to world war i writers such as norman angell argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely he made this argument in 1913 a year later europe s economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the first world war democratic peace theory the democratic peace theory posits that democracy causes peace between democracies because of the accountability institutions values and norms of democratic countries territorial peace theory the territorial peace theory posits that peace causes democracy because territorial wars between neighbor countries lead to authoritarian attitudes and disregard for democratic values this theory is supported by historical studies showing that countries rarely become democratic until after their borders have been settled by territorial peace with neighbor countries war game the peace and war game is an approach in game theory to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts the iterated game hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and computer simulations to study possible strategies of cooperation and aggression as peace makers became richer over time it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated one of the well studied strategies that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on genghis khan i e a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources this led in contrast to the development of what s known as the provokable nice guy strategy a peace maker until attacked improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked by adding the results of all pairwise games for each player one sees that multiple players gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player socialism and managed capitalism socialist communist and left wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries e g lenin j a hobson john strachey argued that capitalism caused war e g through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict this led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace however in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war the economist john maynard keynes 1883 1946 argued that managed capitalism could promote peace this involved international coordination of fiscal monetary policies an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other and a high degree of freedom of trade these ideas underlay keynes s work during world war ii that led to the creation of the international monetary fund and the world bank at bretton woods in 1944 and later of the general agreement on tariffs and trade subsequently the world trade organization international organization and law one of the most influential theories of peace especially since woodrow wilson led the creation of the league of nations at the paris peace conference of 1919 is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of international law promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the league of nations the united nations and other functional international organizations one of the most important early exponents of this view was alfred eckhart zimmern for example in his 1936 book the league of nations and the rule of law trans national solidarity many idealist thinkers about international relations e g in the traditions of kant and karl marx have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples or classes of people spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war one version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students an idea most powerfully advanced by cecil rhodes in the creation of the rhodes scholarships and his successors such as j william fulbright another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources day world peace day celebrated on 21 september was founded as a day to recognize honour and promote peace it is commemorated each year by united nations members studies rankings and periods peace and conflict studies peace and conflict studies is an academic field which identifies and analyses violent and nonviolent behaviours as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non violent social conflicts this is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable human condition one variation peace studies irenology is an interdisciplinary effort aiming at the prevention de escalation and solution of conflicts this contrasts with war studies polemology directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts disciplines involved may include political science geography economics psychology sociology international relations history anthropology religious studies and gender studies as well as a variety of other disciplines measurement and ranking although peace is widely perceived as something intangible various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it the global peace index produced by the institute for economics and peace is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the absence of violence and absence of the fear of violence the 2015 edition of the index ranked 163 countries on their internal and external levels of peace according to the 2017 global peace index iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while syria is the least peaceful one fragile states index formerly known as the failed states index created by the fund for peace focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations this index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics social economy and military facets in countries the 2015 failed state index reports that the most fragile nation is south sudan and the least fragile one is finland university of maryland publishes the peace and conflict instability ledger in order to measure peace it grades 163 countries with 5 indicators and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three year period the most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is slovenia on the contrary afghanistan is the most conflicted nation besides indicated above reports from the institute for economics and peace fund for peace and university of maryland other organizations including george mason university release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness long periods the longest continuing period of peace and neutrality among currently existing states is observed in sweden since 1814 and in switzerland which has had an official policy of neutrality since 1815 this was made possible partly by the periods of relative peace in europe and the world known as pax britannica 1815 1914 pax europaea pax americana since 1950s and pax atomica also since the 1950s other examples of long periods of peace are the isolationistic edo period also known

working group on peace and development frient", "Optimism": "optimism is the attitude or mindset of expecting events to lead to particularly positive favorable desirable and hopeful outcomes a common idiom used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism is a glass filled with water to the halfway point an optimist is said to see the glass as half full while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty in ordinary english optimism may be synonymous with idealism often unrealistic or foolish optimism in particular the term derives from the latin optimum meaning best to be optimistic in the typical sense of the word is to expect the best possible outcome from any given situation this is usually referred to in psychology as dispositional optimism it reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best as a trait it fosters resilience in the face of stress theories of optimism include dispositional models and models of explanatory style methods to measure optimism have been developed within both of these theoretical approaches such as various forms of the life orientation test for the original dispositional definition of optimism and the attributional style questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style variation in optimism between people is somewhat heritable and reflects biological trait systems to some degree a person s optimism is also influenced by environmental factors including family environment and may be learnable optimism may also be related to health psychological optimism dispositional optimism researchers operationalize the term optimism differently depending on their research as with any trait characteristic there are several ways to evaluate optimism such as the life orientation test lot an eight item scale developed in 1985 by michael scheier and charles carver dispositional optimism and pessimism are typically assessed by asking people whether they expect future outcomes to be beneficial or negative see below the lot returns separate optimism and pessimism scores for each individual behaviourally these two scores correlate around r 0 5 optimistic scores on this scale predict better outcomes in relationships higher social status and reduced loss of well being following adversity health preserving behaviors are associated with optimism while health damaging behaviors are associated with pessimism some have argued that optimism is the opposite end of a single dimension with pessimism with any distinction between them reflecting factors such as social desirability confirmatory modelling however supports a two dimensional model and the two dimensions predict different outcomes genetic modelling confirms this independence showing that pessimism and optimism are inherited as independent traits with the typical correlation between them emerging as a result of a general well being factor and family environment influences patients with high dispositional optimism appear to have stronger immune systems since optimism buffers against psychological stressors optimists appear to live longer explanatory style explanatory style is distinct from dispositional theories of optimism while related to life orientation measures of optimism attributional style theory suggests that dispositional optimism and pessimism are reflections of the ways people explain events i e that attributions cause these dispositions an optimist would view defeat as temporary as something that does not apply to other cases and as something that is not their fault measures of attributional style distinguish three dimensions among explanations for events whether these explanations draw on internal versus external causes whether the causes are viewed as stable versus unstable and whether explanations apply globally versus being situationally specific in addition the measures distinguish attributions for positive and negative events optimistic people attribute internal stable and global explanations to good things pessimistic explanations attribute these traits of stability globality and internality to negative events such as relationship difficulty models of optimistic and pessimistic attributions show that attributions themselves are a cognitive style individuals who tend to focus on the global explanations do so for all types of events and the styles correlate among each other in addition individuals vary in how optimistic their attributions are for good events and on how pessimistic their attributions are for bad events still these two traits of optimism and pessimism are un correlated there is much debate about the relationship between explanatory style and optimism some researchers argue that optimism is simply the lay term for what researchers know as explanatory style more commonly it is found that explanatory style is distinct from dispositional optimism so the two should not be used interchangeably as they are marginally correlated at best more research is required to bridge or further differentiate these concepts origins as with all psychological traits differences in both dispositional optimism and pessimism and in attributional style are heritable both optimism and pessimism are strongly influenced by environmental factors including the family environment optimism may be indirectly inherited as a reflection of underlying heritable traits such as intelligence temperament and alcoholism evidence from twin studies shows that the inherited component of the dispositional optimism is about 25 percent making this trait a stable personality dimension and a predictor of life outcomes its genetic origin interacts with environmental influences and other risks to determine the vulnerability to depression across the lifespan many theories assume optimism can be learned and research supports a modest role of family environment acting to raise or lower optimism and lower or raise neuroticism and pessimism work utilising brain imaging and biochemistry suggests that at a biological trait level optimism and pessimism reflect brain systems specialised for the tasks of processing and incorporating beliefs regarding good and bad information respectively assessment life orientation test the life orientation test lot was designed by scheier and carver 1985 to assess dispositional optimism expecting positive or negative outcomes it is one of the more popular tests of optimism and pessimism it was often used in early studies examining these dispositions effects in health related domains scheier and carver s initial research which surveyed college students found that optimistic participants were less likely to show an increase in symptoms like dizziness muscle soreness fatigue blurred vision and other physical complaints than pessimistic respondents there are eight items and four filler items in the test four are positive items e g in uncertain times i usually expect the best and four are negative items e g if something can go wrong for me it will the lot has been revised twice once by the original creators lot r and also by chang maydeu olivares and d zurilla as the extended life orientation test elot the revised life orientation test lot r consists of six items each scored on a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree and four filler items half of the coded items are phrased optimistically the other half in a pessimistic way compared with its previous iteration lot r offers good internal consistency over time despite item overlaps making the correlation between the lot and lot r extremely high attributional style questionnaire the attributional style questionnaire asq is based on the explanatory style model of optimism subjects read a list of six positive and negative events e g you have been looking for a job unsuccessfully for some time and are asked to record a possible cause for the event they then rate whether this is internal or external stable or changeable and global or local to the event there are several modified versions of the asq including the expanded attributional style questionnaire easq the content analysis of verbatim explanations cave and the asq designed for testing the optimism of children associations with health optimism and health are correlated moderately optimism explains between 5 10 of the variation in the likelihood of developing some health conditions correlation coefficients between 20 and 30 notably including cardiovascular disease stroke and depression the relationship between optimism and health has also been studied with regard to physical symptoms coping strategies and negative effects for those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis asthma and fibromyalgia among individuals with these diseases optimists are not more likely than pessimists to report pain alleviation due to coping strategies despite differences in psychological well being between the two groups a meta analysis confirmed the assumption that optimism is related to psychological well being put simply optimists emerge from difficult circumstances with less distress than do pessimists furthermore the correlation appears to be attributable to coping style that is optimists seem intent on facing problems head on taking active and constructive steps to solve their problems pessimists are more likely to abandon their effort to attain their goals optimists may respond better to stress pessimists have shown higher levels of cortisol the stress hormone and trouble regulating cortisol in response to stressors another study by scheier examined the recovery process for a number of patients that had undergone surgery the study showed that optimism was a strong predictor of the rate of recovery optimists achieved faster results in behavioral milestones such as sitting in bed walking around etc they also were rated by staff as having a more favorable physical recovery at a six month follow up optimists were quicker to resume normal activities optimism and well being a number of studies have been done on optimism and psychological well being one 30 year study undertaken by lee et al 2019 assessed the overall optimism and longevity of cohorts of men from the veterans affairs normative aging study and women from the nurses health study the study found a positive correlation between higher levels of optimism and exceptional longevity defined as a lifespan exceeding 85 years another study conducted by aspinwall and taylor 1990 assessed incoming freshmen on a range of personality factors such as optimism self esteem locus of self control etc freshmen who scored high on optimism before entering college had lower levels of psychological distress than their more pessimistic peers while controlling for the other personality factors over time the more optimistic students were less stressed less lonely and less depressed than their pessimistic counterparts this study suggests a strong link between optimism and psychological well being low optimism may help explain the association between caregivers anger and reduced sense of vitality a meta analysis of optimism supported findings that optimism is positively correlated with life satisfaction happiness and psychological and physical well being and negatively correlated with depression and anxiety seeking to explain the correlation researchers find that optimists choose healthier lifestyles for example optimists smoke less are more physically active consume more fruit vegetables and whole grain bread and are more moderate in alcohol consumption translating association into modifiability research to date has demonstrated that optimists are less likely to have certain diseases or develop certain diseases over time research has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability to change an individual s level of optimism through psychological interventions and thereby perhaps alter the course of disease or likelihood for development of disease an article by mayo clinic argues that steps to change self talk from negative to positive may shift individuals from a negative to a more positive optimistic outlook strategies claimed to be of value include surrounding oneself with positive people identifying areas of change practicing positive self talk being open to humor and following a healthy lifestyle there is also the notion of learned optimism in positive psychology which holds that joy is a talent that can be cultivated and can be achieved through specific actions such as challenging negative self talk or overcoming learned helplessness however criticism against positive psychology argues that it places too much importance on upbeat thinking while shunting challenging and difficult experiences to the side threatening to become toxic positivity a study involving twins found that optimism is largely inherited at birth along with the recognition that childhood experiences determine an individual s outlook such studies demonstrate the genetic basis for optimism reinforces the recognized difficulty in changing or manipulating the direction of an adult s disposition from pessimist to optimist philosophical optimism one of the earliest forms of philosophical optimism was socrates theory of moral intellectualism which formed part of his model of enlightenment through the process of self improvement according to the philosopher it is possible to live a virtuous life by attaining moral perfection through philosophical self examination he maintained that knowledge of moral truth is necessary and sufficient for leading a good life in his philosophical investigations socrates followed a model that did not merely focus on the intellect or reason but a balanced practice that also considered emotion as an important contributor to the richness of human experience distinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out there is a philosophical idea that perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended the present moment is in an optimum state this view that all of nature past present and future operates by laws of optimization along the lines of hamilton s principle in the realm of physics is countered by views such as idealism realism and philosophical pessimism philosophers often link the concept of optimism with the name of gottfried wilhelm leibniz who held that we live in the best of all possible worlds le meilleur des mondes possibles or that god created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics the concept was also reflected in an aspect of voltaire s early philosophy one that was based on isaac newton s view that described a divinely ordered human condition this philosophy would also later emerge in alexander pope s essay on man leibniz proposed that it was not god s power to create a perfect world but he created the best among possible worlds in one of his writings he responded to blaise pascal s philosophy of awe and desperation in the face of the infinite by claiming that infinity should be celebrated while pascal advocated for making man s rational aspirations more humble leibniz was optimistic about the capacity of human reason to extend itself further this idea was mocked by voltaire in his satirical novel candide as baseless optimism of the sort exemplified by the beliefs of one of its characters dr pangloss which are the opposite of his fellow traveller martin s pessimism and emphasis on free will the optimistic position is also called panglossianism which became an term for excessive even stupendous optimism the phrase panglossian pessimism has been used to describe the pessimistic position that since this is the best of all possible worlds it is impossible for anything to get any better conversely philosophical pessimism might be associated with an optimistic long term view because it implies that no change for the worse is possible voltaire found it difficult to reconcile leibniz s optimism with human suffering as demonstrated by the earthquake that devastated lisbon in 1755 and the atrocities committed by the pre revolutionary france against its people optimalism as defined by nicholas rescher philosophical optimalism holds that this universe exists because it is better than the alternatives while this philosophy does not exclude the possibility of a deity it also does not require one and is compatible with atheism rescher explained that the concept can stand on its own feet arguing that there is no necessity to seeing optimalism realization as divinely instituted because it is a naturalistic theory in principle psychological optimalism as defined by the positive psychologist tal ben shahar means willingness to accept failure while remaining confident that success will follow a positive attitude he contrasts with negative perfectionism perfectionism can be defined as a persistent compulsive drive toward unattainable goals and valuation based solely in terms of accomplishment perfectionists reject the realities and constraints of human ability they cannot accept failures delaying any ambitious and productive behavior in fear of failing again this neuroticism can even lead to clinical depression and low productivity as an alternative to negative perfectionism ben shahar suggests the adoption of optimalism optimalism allows for failure in pursuit of a goal and expects that while the trend of activity is towards the positive it is not necessary always to succeed while striving towards goals this basis in reality prevents the optimalist from being overwhelmed in the face of failure optimalists accept failures and learn from them encouraging further pursuit of achievement ben shahar believes that optimalists and perfectionists show distinct motives optimalists tend to have more intrinsic inward desires with a motivation to learn while perfectionists are highly motivated by a need to prove themselves worthy consistently two additional facets of optimalism have been described product optimalism and process optimalism the former is described as an outlook that seeks to realize the best possible result while the latter seeks maximization of the chances of achieving the best possible result some sources also distinguish the concept from optimism since it does not focus on how things are going well but on whether things are going as well as possible see also affirmations new age practice of positive thinking and self empowerment agathism explanatory style mood psychology relatively long lasting

life in general a common question asked to test for pessimism is is the glass half empty or half full in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty or in extreme cases completely empty while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full throughout history the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking etymology the term pessimism derives from the latin word pessimus meaning the worst it was first used by jesuit critics of voltaire s 1759 novel candide ou l optimisme voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of leibniz who maintained that this was the best optimum of all possible worlds in their attacks on voltaire the jesuits of the revue de tr\u00e9voux accused him of pessimisme 9 as a psychological disposition in the ancient world psychological pessimism was associated with melancholy and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body the study of pessimism has parallels with the study of depression psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional pain or even biology aaron beck argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts pessimists however are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified as in depressive realism or pessimistic realism deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed they let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding the pessimism item on the beck depression inventory has been judged useful in predicting suicides the beck hopelessness scale has also been described as a measurement of pessimism wender and klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances if one is subject to a series of defeats it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook similarly if one is raking in the chips of life it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach and thus maximize access to scarce resources the leading causes of pessimism are genetics past experience and social and environmental factors one study of 5 187 teenage twins and their siblings suggests that genetics may account for one third of the variance in whether someone leans toward pessimism vs optimism with the remaining variance due to their environment and twin studies suggest that when it comes to personality about half the differences between us are because of genetic factors but spector points out that throughout our lives in response to environmental factors our genes are constantly being dialled up and down as with a dimmer switch a process known as epigenetics criticism pragmatic criticism through history some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude although justified must be avoided to endure optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration al ghazali and william james rejected their pessimism after suffering psychological or even psychosomatic illness criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression many philosophers would disagree claiming that the term pessimism is being abused the link between pessimism and nihilism is present but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter as philosophers such as albert camus believed happiness is not inextricably linked to optimism nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness one could easily imagine an unhappy optimist and a happy pessimist accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism the economist nouriel roubini who introduces himself as dr doom was largely dismissed as a pessimist for his dire but to some extent accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis in 2006 however financial journalist justin fox observed in the harvard business review in 2010 that in fact roubini didn t exactly predict the crisis that began in mid 2007 roubini spent several years predicting a very different sort of crisis one in which foreign central banks diversifying their holdings out of treasuries sparked a run on the dollar only to turn in late 2006 to warning of a u s housing bust and a global hard landing he still didn t give a perfectly clear or in retrospect accurate vision of how exactly this would play out i m more than a little weirded out by the status of prophet that he has been accorded since others noted that the problem is that even though he was spectacularly right on this one he went on to predict time and time again as the markets and the economy recovered in the years following the collapse that there would be a follow up crisis and that more extreme crashes were inevitable his calls after his initial pronouncement were consistently wrong indeed if you had listened to him and many investors did you would have missed the longest bull market run in us market history another observed for a prophet he s wrong an awful lot of the time tony robbins wrote roubini warned of a recession in 2004 wrongly 2005 wrongly 2006 wrongly and 2007 wrongly and he predicted wrongly that there d be a significant stock market correction in 2013 speaking about roubini economist anirvan banerji told the new york times even a stopped clock is right twice a day economist nariman behravesh said nouriel roubini has been singing the doom and gloom story for 10 years eventually something was going to be right personality plus opines that pessimistic temperaments e g melancholy and phlegmatic can be useful inasmuch as pessimists focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments e g choleric and sanguine miss other forms of pessimism philosophical pessimism philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition but rather it is a worldview or philosophical position that assigns a negative value to life or existence philosophical pessimists commonly argue that the world contains an empirical prevalence of pains over pleasures that existence is ontologically or metaphysically adverse to living beings and that life is fundamentally meaningless or without purpose political and cultural philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the optimism or even utopianism of hegelian philosophies emil cioran claimed hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism how could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities but never progresses philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti systematic philosophy of individual action 7 this is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of social progress can actually improve the human condition as cioran states every step forward is followed by a step back this is the unfruitful oscillation of history cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an idolatry of tomorrow which can be used to authorize anything in its name this does not mean however that the pessimist cannot be politically involved as camus argued in the rebel 1951 pessimism about the human condition was also expressed by hobbes 1588 1679 there is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview this is the pessimism of cultural criticism and social decline anthony trollope summarised the attitude with gentle mockery in 1880 everything is going wrong farmers are generally on the verge of ruin trade is always bad the church is in danger the house of lords isn t worth a dozen years purchase the throne totters oswald spengler s the decline of the west 1918 1922 popularised pessimism spengler promoted a cyclic model of history similar to the theories of giambattista vico 1668 1744 spengler believed that modern western civilization was in a winter age of decline german untergang spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar europe especially in weimar germany similarly traditionalist julius evola 1898 1974 thought that the world was in the kali yuga a dark age of moral decline intellectuals such as oliver james correlate economic progress with economic inequality the stimulation of artificial needs and affluenza anti consumerists identify rising trends of conspicuous consumption and self interested image conscious behavior in culture post modernists like jean baudrillard 1929 2007 have even argued that culture and therefore our lives now has no basis in reality whatsoever conservative thinkers especially social conservatives often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way william f buckley famously remarked that he was standing athwart history yelling stop and whittaker chambers 1901 1961 was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to communism though he himself became staunchly anti communist social conservatives often see the west as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in christianity and or greek philosophy leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay robert bork s slouching toward gomorrah and allan bloom s the closing of the american mind are famous expressions of this point of view many economic conservatives and libertarians believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable and that they are at best fighting a holding action against it they hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the welfare state political pessimism has sometimes found expression in dystopian novels such as george orwell s nineteen eighty four political pessimism about one s country often correlates with a desire to emigrate during the 2008 financial crisis in the united states the neologism pessimism porn came to describe the alleged eschatological and survivalist thrill some people derive from predicting reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world s economic system puolanka a municipality located in the kainuu region in the northern finland has been called the most pessimistic municipality in finland and in 2019 the municipality gained worldwide publicity when the bbc published a video about puolanka describing it as the most pessimistic town in the world pessimism has a long tradition in the kainuu region mostly because kainuu was a poor region that had often suffered from famines in the late 19th century and early 20th century which is why the region is also called a hunger land technological and environmental technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the industrial revolution with the luddite movement luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them the romantic movement was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times poets like william wordsworth and william blake believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature some social critics and environmentalists believe that globalization overpopulation and the economic practices of modern capitalist states over stress the planet s ecological equilibrium they warn that unless something is done to slow this climate change will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and ecological collapse james lovelock believes that the ecology of the earth has already been irretrievably damaged and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it according to lovelock the earth s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls polyanthroponemia which is when humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good lovelock states the presence of 7 billion people aiming for first world comforts is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry biological diversity and the economy of the system some radical environmentalists anti globalization activists and neo luddites can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern progress a more radical form of environmental pessimism is anarcho primitivism which faults the agricultural revolution with giving rise to social stratification coercion and alienation some anarcho primitivists promote deindustrialization abandonment of modern technology and rewilding an infamous anarcho primitivist is theodore kaczynski also known as the unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign in his 1995 unabomber manifesto he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern industrial technological system the manifesto begins thus the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race they have greatly increased the life expectancy of those of us who live in advanced countries but they have destabilized society have made life unfulfilling have subjected human beings to indignities have led to widespread psychological suffering in the third world to physical suffering as well and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world the continued development of technology will worsen the situation it will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in advanced countries one of the most radical pessimist organizations is the voluntary human extinction movement which argues for the extinction of the human race through antinatalism pope francis controversial 2015 encyclical on ecological issues is rife with pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world entropy pessimism entropy pessimism represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism based on thermodynamic principles 116 according to the first law of thermodynamics matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy according to the second law of thermodynamics also known as the entropy law what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes valuable natural resources to states unavailable for human purposes valueless waste and pollution in effect all of man s technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary heat death of degraded energy exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment a state of maximum entropy locally on earth locally on earth that is when compared to the heat death of the universe taken as a whole the term entropy pessimism was coined to describe the work of romanian american economist nicholas georgescu roegen a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics 116 georgescu roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on the entropy law and the economic process since the 1990s leading ecological economist and steady state theorist herman daly a student of georgescu roegen had been the economic profession s most influential proponent of entropy pessimism prior to his death in 2022 545 among other matters the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth s finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations this number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us as there is no way or only little way of knowing in advance if or when humankind will ultimately face extinction in effect any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point 369 371 253 256 165 168 171 150 153 106 109 546 549 142 145 entropy pessimism is a widespread view in ecological economics and in the degrowth movement legal bibas writes that some criminal defense attorneys prefer to err on the side of pessimism optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial an embarrassing result that makes clients angry on the other hand if clients plead based on their lawyers overly pessimistic advice the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none

beliefs or behaviors folk custom passed down within a group of people or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past a component of cultural expressions and folklore common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes like lawyers wigs or military officers spurs but the idea has also been applied to social norms and behaviors such as greetings etc traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years the word tradition itself derives from the latin word tradere literally meaning to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping while it is reportedly assumed that traditions have an ancient history many traditions have been invented on purpose whether it be political or cultural over short periods of time various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways the phrase according to tradition or by tradition usually means that what follows is known only through oral tradition and is not supported and might even be refuted by solid evidence here tradition describes the source or nature of the information for example according to tradition homer was born on chios but many other places have historically claimed him as theirs this tradition may never be proven or disproved another example is king arthur according to history a true british king has inspired many well loved stories whether the claims are supported by evidence or not does not reduce their value as cultural history and literature traditions are subject of study in several academic fields of learning especially in the humanities and social sciences including anthropology archaeology history and sociology the conceptualization of tradition as the notion of holding on to a previous time is also found in political and philosophical discourse for example it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism and also strands of many world religions including traditional catholicism in artistic contexts tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form for example in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer s own preferences a host of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization globalization and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups in response to this tradition preservation attempts and initiatives have now been started in many countries around the world focusing on aspects such as traditional languages tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts definition the english word tradition comes from the latin traditio via french the noun from the verb tradere to transmit to hand over to give for safekeeping it was originally used in roman law to refer to the concept of legal transfers and inheritance according to anthony giddens and others the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the enlightenment period in opposition to modernity and progress as with many other generic terms there are many definitions of tradition the concept includes a number of interrelated ideas the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs objects or customs performed or believed in the past originating in it transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the other and are performed or believed in the present tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are prehistoric with lost or arcane origins existing from time immemorial originally traditions were passed orally without the need for a writing system tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme epic stories and alliteration the stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition or as part of an oral tradition even such traditions however are presumed to have originated been invented by humans at some point traditions are often presumed to be ancient unalterable and deeply important though they may sometimes be much less natural than is presumed it is presumed that at least two transmissions over three generations are required for a practice belief or object to be seen as traditional some traditions were deliberately introduced for one reason or another often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution or truth traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition tradition changes slowly with changes from one generation to the other being seen as significant thus those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations it will be seen as unchanged there are various origins and fields of tradition they can refer to the forms of artistic heritage of a particular culture beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments such as national anthems and national holidays such as federal holidays in the united states beliefs or customs maintained by religious denominations and church bodies that share history customs culture and to some extent body of teachings for example one can speak of islam s tradition or christianity s tradition many objects beliefs and customs can be traditional rituals of social interaction can be traditional with phrases and gestures such as saying thank you sending birth announcements greeting cards etc tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups family traditions at christmas organizations company s picnic or societies such as the practice of national and public holidays some of the oldest traditions include monotheism three millennia and citizenship two millennia it can also include material objects such as buildings works of art or tools tradition is often used as an adjective in contexts such as traditional music traditional medicine traditional values and others in such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context passed through generations invention of tradition the term invention of tradition introduced by e j hobsbawm refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present a tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal commercial political or national self interest as was done in colonial africa or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event rather than developing and spreading organically in a population as in the case of the white wedding dress which only became popular after queen victoria wore a white gown at her wedding to albert of saxe coburg an example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the palace of westminster location of the british parliament in the gothic style similarly most of the traditions associated with monarchy of the united kingdom seen as rooted deep in history actually date to 19th century other examples include the invention of tradition in africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces requiring legitimacy the colonial power would often invent a tradition which they could use to legitimize their own position for example a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job often these inventions were based in some form of tradition but were exaggerated distorted or biased toward a particular interpretation invented traditions are central components of modern national cultures providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by nationalism common examples include public holidays particularly those unique to a particular nation the singing of national anthems and traditional national cuisine see national dish expatriate and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation in scholarly discourse in science tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author s thoughts to that of his or her field in 1948 philosopher of science karl popper suggested that there should be a rational theory of tradition applied to science which was fundamentally sociological for popper each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it unlike myth which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism scientific tradition was inherited from socrates who proposed critical discussion according to popper for thomas kuhn who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977 a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is historically what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in social sciences chiefly anthropology archaeology and biology with somewhat different meanings in different fields it is also used in varying contexts in other fields such as history psychology and sociology social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis in the 1970s and 1980s edward shils explored the concept in detail since then a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition meanwhile tradition has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions perspectives approaches in those disciplines anthropology tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology it can be said that anthropology is the study of tradition in traditional societies there is however no theory of tradition as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary as defining tradition is both unnecessary everyone can be expected to know what it is and unimportant as small differences in definition would be just technical there are however dissenting views scholars such as pascal boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline archaeology in archaeology the term tradition is a set of cultures or industries which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time the term is especially common in the study of american archaeology biology biologists when examining groups of non humans have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next tradition is defined in biology as a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring i e is performed repeatedly over a period of time that is shared among two or more members of a group that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners and has been called a precursor to culture in the anthropological sense behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish birds and mammals groups of orangutans and chimpanzees in particular may display large numbers of behavioral traditions and in chimpanzees transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another not just within a group has been observed such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change musicology and ethnomusicology in the field of musicology and ethnomusicology tradition refers to the belief systems repertoire techniques style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns along with a sense of history traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time while both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being the scholarly study of music they differ in their methodology and subject of research tradition or traditions can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide ranging historical perspective sociology the concept of tradition in early sociological research around the turn of the 19th and 20th century referred to that of the traditional society as contrasted by the more modern industrial society this approach was most notably portrayed in max weber s concepts of traditional authority and modern rational legal authority in more modern works one hundred years later sociology sees tradition as a social construct used to contrast past with the present and as a form of rationality used to justify certain course of action traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business division of labor influenced primarily by age gender and status high position of custom in the system of values self sufficiency preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment relative autarky early theories positing the simple unilineal evolution of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic in 1981 edward shils in his book tradition put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted according to shils tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality it is also related to the works of max weber see theories of rationality and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by raymond boudon in his book action in this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as it has always been that way this line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition or argumentum ad antiquitatem which takes the form this is right because we ve always done it this way in most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the tradition being advocated may no longer be desirable or indeed may never have been despite its previous popularity philosophy the idea of tradition is important in philosophy twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an analytic tradition dominant in anglophone and scandinavian countries and a continental tradition dominant in german and romance speaking europe increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents following martin heidegger call the tradition which began with plato and aristotle in contrast some continental philosophers most notably hans georg gadamer have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of aristotelianism this move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by alasdair macintyre however macintyre has himself deconstructed the idea of the tradition instead posing aristotelianism as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others in political and religious discourse the concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values in the united states in the twentieth and twenty first centuries the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values similarly strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition although tradition or its plural can also refer simply to the core teaching of religious group thus paul in 1 corinthians 11 2 refers to the traditions even as i delivered them to you the term traditionalist catholic refers to those such as archbishop lefebvre who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the second vatican council of 1962 65 likewise sunni muslims are referred to as ahl el sunnah wa al jam\u0101 ah arabic \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629 literally people of the tradition of muhammad and the community emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition more generally tradition has been used as a way of determining the political spectrum with right wing parties having a stronger affinity to certain ways of the past than left wing ones here the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism or simply traditionalism which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order hierarchy and organic unity agrarianism classicism and high culture and the intersecting spheres of loyalty traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism liberalism modernity and social progress but promote cultural and educational renewal and revive interest in the church the family the state and local community this view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable for example stereotypical views of the place of women in domestic affairs in other societies especially ones experiencing rapid social change the idea of what is traditional may be widely contested with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be the means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society in other cases tradition is a means of othering and keeping groups distinct from one another in artistic discourse in artistic contexts in the performance of traditional genres such as traditional dance adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer s preferences it is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional for artistic endeavors tradition has been used as a contrast to creativity with traditional and folk art associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition in contrast to fine art which is valued for being original and unique more recent philosophy of art however considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression relationship to other concepts in the social sciences tradition is often contrasted with modernity particularly in terms of whole societies this dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern tradition oriented societies have been characterized as valuing filial piety harmony and group welfare stability and interdependence while a society exhibiting modernity would value individualism with free will and choice mobility and progress another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity anthony giddens sees tradition as something bound to ritual where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition gusfield and others though criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified arguing that tradition is dynamic heterogeneous and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals tradition should be differentiated from customs conventions laws norms routines rules and similar concepts whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change whereas justification for tradition is ideological the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical over time customs routines conventions rules and such can evolve into traditions but that usually requires that they stop having primarily a practical purpose for example wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable spurs worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional preservation the legal protection of tradition includes a number of international agreements and national laws in addition to the fundamental protection of cultural property there is also cooperation between the united nations unesco and blue shield international in the protection or recording of traditions and customs the protection of culture and traditions is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally in many countries concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost a number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition including industrialization globalization and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved likewise the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as cornish under the auspices of the european charter for regional or minority languages specifically the charter holds that these languages contribute to the maintenance and development of europe s cultural wealth and traditions the charter goes on to call for the use or adoption of traditional and correct forms of place names in regional or minority languages similarly unesco includes both oral tradition and traditional manifestations in its definition of a country s cultural properties and heritage so therefore it works to preserve tradition in countries such as brazil in japan certain artworks structures craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the japanese government to be a precious legacy of the japanese people and are protected under the japanese law for the protection of cultural properties this law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as national living treasures and encourages the preservation of their craft for native peoples like the m\u0101ori in new zealand there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition traditional cultural expressions the phrase traditional cultural expressions is used by the world intellectual property organization to refer to any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied they are transmitted from one generation to the next and include handmade textiles paintings stories legends ceremonies music songs rhythms and dance see also folklore origin myth perennial philosophy sacred tradition references citations works cited
