environment increase desire pursuit biparental monogamous relationship strategic pluralism theory strategic pluralism theory focus environmental factor influence mating strategy according theory people live within environment demanding stressful need bi parental care greater increasing survival offspring correspondingly monogamy commitment commonplace hand people live within environment encompass little stress threat viability offspring need serious committed relation lowered therefore promiscuity infidelity common sex ratio theory sex ratio theory theory explains relationship sexual dynamic within different area world based ratio number marriage aged men marriage aged woman according theory area high sex ratio higher number marriage aged woman marriage aged men area low sex ratio marriage aged men term infidelity theory state sex ratio high men likely promiscuous engage sex outside committed relationship demand men higher type behavior desired men accepted hand sex ratio low promiscuity less common woman demand since desire monogamy commitment order men remain competitive pool mate must respond desire support theory come evidence showing higher divorce rate country higher sex ratio higher monogamy rate country lower sex ratio contributing factor infidelity mean exclusive certain group people perception influenced factor furthermore within homogeneous culture like

population size present threat publicly recognized infidelity however within larger community mexican society entering bar watering hole would garner different view would deemed perfectly acceptable married unmarried individual drink bar large city observation paralleled rural urban society united state well ultimately variable societal difference dictate attitude towards sexual infidelity vary across culture well within culture mate poaching phenomenon single person luring person intimate relationship leave partner single person according survey 16 964 individual 53 country david schmitt 2001 mate poaching happens significantly frequently middle eastern country turkey lebanon less frequently east asian country china japan evolutionary factor parental investment theory used explain
